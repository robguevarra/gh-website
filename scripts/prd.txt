## User Experience

### Admin Persona
- Platform administrators responsible for user management and support
- Technical comfort level: Medium to high
- Primary goals: Efficiently manage user accounts, resolve support issues, analyze user behavior

### Key User Flows
1. User Search and Identification
   - Admin searches for a user by email, name, or other attributes
   - System returns matching users with key information
   - Admin selects user to view detailed profile

2. User Profile Management
   - Admin views comprehensive user details
   - Admin makes necessary changes to profile information
   - System validates changes and provides confirmation
   - System logs administrative action for audit purposes

3. Enrollment and Access Management
   - Admin reviews user's current access and enrollments
   - Admin adjusts permissions or enrollment status as needed
   - System applies changes and notifies user if configured
   - System logs changes for compliance and tracking

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, professional interface with clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design working across all device sizes
- Consistent use of Shadcn UI components for familiar interaction patterns
- Clear feedback for all administrative actions
- Keyboard accessibility and screen reader support
- Efficient layouts minimizing clicks for common tasks

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
1. User List View (/admin/users)
   - Server component for data fetching with pagination
   - Client components for interactive filtering and sorting
   - Data table with customizable columns and quick actions

2. User Detail View (/admin/users/[id])
   - Multi-tabbed interface for different information categories
   - Form components for editable fields with validation
   - Data visualization components for metrics and trends

3. Data Access Layer
   - Server-side functions for secure data operations
   - SQL queries optimized for common user management operations
   - Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions where appropriate

### Data Models
- unified_profiles: Core user data from unified data model
- enrollments: Course enrollment data for users
- shopify_orders and shopify_order_items: Current purchase data
- ecommerce_orders and ecommerce_order_items: Future purchase data
- user_notes: Administrative annotations for user accounts
- admin_audit_log: Tracking of administrative actions

### APIs and Integrations
- Supabase API for database operations
- Server actions for secure client-server communication
- Integration with existing analytics for comprehensive reporting

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Next.js 15+ with App Router for routing and server components
- Supabase for database and authentication
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for consistent styling

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: User Data Model & Schema Enhancement
- Audit existing user-related tables and relationships
- Implement additional tables/fields for administrative needs
- Develop data access patterns for efficient querying

### Phase 2: User List View Implementation
- Create responsive data table at /admin/users
- Implement robust search and filtering capabilities
- Develop sorting and pagination functionality

### Phase 3: User Detail View Implementation
- Build comprehensive user profile at /admin/users/[id]
- Implement purchase history and enrollment sections
- Create activity and engagement tracking visualizations

### Phase 4: User Account Reconciliation
- Develop interface for searching users across different systems
- Build manual account linking functionality
- Implement automated data synchronization
- Add detailed logging and audit trail

### Phase 5: User Management Actions
- Create user editing capabilities with validation
- Implement access management features
- Build administrative tooling for account management

### Phase 6: User Analytics and Reporting
- Design and implement user analytics dashboard
- Build reporting and export functionality
- Integrate with platform-wide analytics

## Logical Dependency Chain

1. Data Model Enhancement (Foundation)
   - Must be completed first as all other features depend on proper data structures
   - Focus on unified_profiles structure and relationships to other tables

2. User List View (Initial Visible Interface)
   - First user-facing component to deliver value quickly
   - Allows basic user management while detail view is developed

3. User Detail View (Core Functionality)
   - Builds on list view to provide comprehensive user information
   - Delivers essential management capabilities for administrators

4. Account Reconciliation (Data Integrity)
   - Ensures data quality and consistency across systems
   - Supports proper user identification and management

5. Management Actions (Administrative Power)
   - Builds on previous components to enable administrative control
   - Delivers complete user management capabilities

6. Analytics and Reporting (Business Intelligence)
   - Final layer providing insights and business value
   - Leverages all previous components for comprehensive analysis

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- Risk: Performance issues with large datasets
  Mitigation: Implement efficient pagination, caching, and optimized queries

- Risk: Data inconsistency across different systems
  Mitigation: Develop robust reconciliation tools and data validation

- Risk: Security vulnerabilities in admin functions
  Mitigation: Implement proper access controls, input validation, and audit logging

### MVP Scope Management
- Risk: Feature creep extending development timeline
  Mitigation: Clearly define MVP requirements and separate enhancement features

- Risk: Complexity of user reconciliation features
  Mitigation: Break into manageable components with incremental delivery

### Resource Constraints
- Risk: Limited development resources for comprehensive system
  Mitigation: Prioritize features based on administrative needs and impact

- Risk: Technical debt from rapid implementation
  Mitigation: Follow established coding standards and architectural patterns
