# Handoff Document: Admin Activity Logging - Phase 1 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-06-06
**Author:** Cascade (AI) / User (Rob Guevarra)
**Project Area:** Admin Console - Core Infrastructure
**Feature:** Admin Activity Logging System

## 1. Context & Objective

The primary objective was to implement a robust admin activity logging system to track significant actions performed by administrators within the admin console. This system is crucial for audit trails, security monitoring, and understanding admin behavior. This phase focused on establishing the database schema, creating a generic logging server action, and integrating it into an initial admin function.

## 2. Summary of Work Completed

*   **Database Schema Established:**
    *   A new table `admin_activity_log` was created in the Supabase database.
    *   Fields include `admin_user_id`, `target_user_id`, `target_entity_id`, `activity_type`, `description`, `details` (JSONB), `ip_address`, and `created_at`.
    *   A new ENUM type `activity_log_type` was defined to categorize various admin actions (e.g., `AFFILIATE_STATUS_CHANGE`, `FRAUD_FLAG_RESOLVED`, etc.).
*   **`logAdminActivity` Server Action (`lib/actions/activity-log-actions.ts`):**
    *   A dedicated server action was created to handle the insertion of log entries into the `admin_activity_log` table.
    *   This action can automatically determine the acting admin's user ID using `@supabase/ssr` if not explicitly provided.
    *   Resolved TypeScript linting issues related to Supabase types and `cookies()` API usage within this action.
*   **Supabase TypeScript Types Regenerated:**
    *   Successfully regenerated `types/supabase.ts` to ensure the new `admin_activity_log` table and `activity_log_type` enum were correctly recognized by TypeScript, resolving critical type errors.
*   **Initial Integration - `updateAffiliateStatus`:**
    *   The `updateAffiliateStatus` server action in `lib/actions/affiliate-actions.ts` was significantly refactored.
    *   It now fetches the affiliate's current status and `user_id` *before* performing the update.
    *   Successfully integrated a call to `logAdminActivity` to record when an affiliate's status is changed by an admin. The log includes details like old status, new status, and the affected affiliate. Logging only occurs if the status actually changes.

## 3. Key Files Modified/Created

*   **New Files:**
    *   `lib/actions/activity-log-actions.ts`: Contains the `logAdminActivity` server action.
*   **Modified Files:**
    *   `lib/actions/affiliate-actions.ts`: Refactored `updateAffiliateStatus` to include a call to `logAdminActivity`.
    *   `types/supabase.ts`: Regenerated to include new database schema elements for activity logging.
*   **Database (Schema - previously established, now utilized):**
    *   `public.admin_activity_log` (Table)
    *   `public.activity_log_type` (Enum)

## 4. Technical Stack & Patterns

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15+ (App Router)
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Server Actions:** Used for all backend logic and database interactions.
*   **Authentication:** `@supabase/ssr` for server-side Supabase client creation and user context retrieval in server actions.
*   **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality.

## 5. Potential Blockers / Known Issues / Points to Verify

*   **`cookies()` API Type Inference:** The `cookies()` function from `next/headers` sometimes presents type inference challenges in Server Actions (appearing as a Promise when it should be synchronous). Workarounds (e.g., `await cookies()`, `@ts-ignore`) are in place in `logAdminActivity` but ideally, future Next.js/TypeScript updates might improve this.
*   **IP Address Capturing:** The `logAdminActivity` action includes an `ip_address` field, but a consistent mechanism for capturing and passing the admin's IP address to this action from various calling contexts (e.g., server actions, API routes if any) needs to be established if this is a requirement.

## 6. Suggested Next Steps

*   **Integrate `logAdminActivity` into More Admin Actions:**
    *   `updateAffiliateProgramSettings` (in `lib/actions/affiliate-actions.ts`)
    *   `resolveFraudFlag` (in `lib/actions/affiliate-actions.ts`)
    *   `updateAffiliateMembershipLevel` (in `lib/actions/affiliate-actions.ts`)
    *   Any other server actions where admin changes occur (e.g., user profile updates by admin, course modifications, etc.).
*   **Develop "Recent Activity" Feed UI:**
    *   Create a server action to fetch recent entries from `admin_activity_log`.
    *   Build a React client component to display this feed on the admin analytics page (or a dedicated audit log page).
*   **IP Address Strategy:** Decide on and implement a strategy for capturing the admin's IP address if required for logging.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the logging for each integrated action to ensure accuracy and completeness of logged data.

This document outlines the foundational work for the admin activity logging system. The next steps will involve expanding its coverage across the admin console.
