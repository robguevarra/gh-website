# Graceful Homeschooling Platform Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for transitioning from the current systeme.io platform to our custom Next.js-based solution with integrated LMS, user management, email marketing, and e-commerce capabilities.

## Project Overview

**Current State**: The Graceful Homeschooling website currently exists as a Next.js 15 application with core pages. User management, course delivery, and email marketing are handled by systeme.io, while e-commerce is managed through Shopify.
