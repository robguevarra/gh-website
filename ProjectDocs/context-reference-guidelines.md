# Graceful Homeschooling Context Reference Guidelines

This document defines the standards and best practices for creating, maintaining, and referencing context documents in the Graceful Homeschooling platform.

## Table of Contents

1. [Purpose](#purpose)
2. [Context Document Types](#context-document-types)
3. [Creating Context Documents](#creating-context-documents)
4. [Referencing Context](#referencing-context)
5. [Context Maintenance](#context-maintenance)
6. [Templates](#templates)

## Purpose

Context documents serve as authoritative references that:

- **Establish Standards**: Define consistent approaches across the project
- **Capture Decisions**: Document key architectural and design decisions
- **Guide Development**: Provide direction for implementation
- **Preserve Knowledge**: Record critical information for future reference

Well-maintained context documents reduce decision fatigue, ensure consistency, and facilitate onboarding new team members.

## Context Document Types

The Graceful Homeschooling platform uses several types of context documents:

### Project Context (`ProjectContext.md`)

The master context document that defines:

- Project vision, goals, and scope
- Core requirements and constraints
- Technical stack and architecture decisions
- Feature priorities and roadmap
- Integration requirements
- Business rules and domain logic

### Design Context (`designContext.md`)

The design system reference that defines:

- Brand guidelines and visual language
- UI component patterns and usage
- Interaction patterns and behaviors
- Accessibility standards
- Responsive design approach
- Design tokens and theme configuration

### Technical Context Documents

Specialized documents for specific technical domains:

- **API Context** (`apiContext.md`): API design principles, patterns, and conventions
- **Database Context** (`databaseContext.md`): Schema design, relationships, and access patterns
- **Authentication Context** (`authContext.md`): Authentication flows, permissions, and security approaches

### Feature Context Documents

Detailed requirements and design specifications for major feature areas:

- **Course Management Context** (`courseManagementContext.md`)
- **User Management Context** (`userManagementContext.md`)
- **Reporting Context** (`reportingContext.md`)

## Creating Context Documents

### File Location

All context documents should be stored in the `ProjectDocs/contexts/` directory:

```
ProjectDocs/
  ├── contexts/
  │   ├── ProjectContext.md         # Master project context
  │   ├── designContext.md          # Design system context
  │   ├── technical/                # Technical domain contexts
  │   │   ├── apiContext.md
  │   │   ├── databaseContext.md
  │   │   └── authContext.md
  │   └── features/                 # Feature-specific contexts
  │       ├── courseManagementContext.md
  │       ├── userManagementContext.md
  │       └── reportingContext.md
```

### Required Structure

All context documents should follow this structure:

#### 1. Title and Overview

```markdown
# Project Context: Graceful Homeschooling Platform

This document defines the core project context for the Graceful Homeschooling platform, including vision, goals, requirements, and technical decisions.

## Overview

The Graceful Homeschooling platform aims to provide comprehensive homeschooling resources, curriculum management, and progress tracking for homeschooling families. This document serves as the authoritative reference for project direction and decision-making.

## Project Vision and Goals

### Vision Statement
The Graceful Homeschooling platform empowers homeschooling families with flexible, high-quality educational tools that adapt to their unique learning approaches and needs.

### Key Goals
1. **Comprehensive Curriculum Management**: Provide tools for organizing, customizing, and tracking curriculum.
2. **Personalized Learning**: Support individualized education plans and learning paths.
3. **Community Building**: Connect homeschooling families for support and resource sharing.

## Core Requirements

### Must-Have Features
- Course creation and management
- Student enrollment and progress tracking
- Resource library with searching and filtering
- Assessment and grading tools
- Reporting and documentation generation

### Future Enhancements
- Community forums and messaging
- Resource marketplace
- Advanced analytics and recommendations
- Mobile application
```

#### 5. Decision Records

Document key decisions with context and rationale:

```markdown
## Decision Records

### DR-001: Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Implement authentication using Supabase Auth with PKCE flow.

**Context**: The platform requires secure authentication with support for multiple providers (email, Google, Apple) and role-based permissions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Auth0: More expensive at scale, though feature-rich
2. Firebase Auth: Ties the project to Google's ecosystem
3. Custom implementation: Higher development and maintenance overhead

**Rationale**: Supabase Auth provides a balance of features, security, and cost-effectiveness while integrating seamlessly with our database layer.

**Implications**:
- Simplifies authentication implementation
- Provides built-in support for multiple providers
- Reduces development time for permission management
- May require custom solutions for complex permission scenarios
```

#### 6. References and Related Documents

```markdown
## References and Related Documents

- [Design Context](./designContext.md): UI components and patterns
- [Database Context](./technical/databaseContext.md): Data model and schema
- [Course Management Context](./features/courseManagementContext.md): Detailed course feature specifications
```

## Referencing Context

### When to Reference Context

Reference context documents in:

1. **Build Notes**: When implementing features or components
2. **Technical Documentation**: When explaining architectural decisions
3. **Code Comments**: For complex implementations influenced by context
4. **Pull Request Descriptions**: To justify implementation approaches

### How to Reference Context

#### In Build Notes

Use block quotes with specific references:

```markdown
> From the **Project Context** (`ProjectContext.md`):
> 
> **Authentication Flow**:
> > "The platform will implement the PKCE authentication flow with Supabase Auth, supporting email/password, Google, and Apple authentication providers."
>
> This informs our implementation of the sign-up and login components.
```

#### In Code Comments

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new course with initial module structure.
 * 
 * Following ProjectContext.md requirements for course structure:
 * - Courses must have at least one module
 * - Each module must have a title and description
 * - Modules must allow for lesson ordering
 * 
 * @see /ProjectDocs/contexts/features/courseManagementContext.md
 */
export async function createCourse(courseData: CreateCourseInput): Promise<Course> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### In Pull Request Descriptions

```markdown
This PR implements the course enrollment feature as specified in:
- `/ProjectDocs/contexts/features/courseManagementContext.md` (Section 3.2: Enrollment Flow)
- `/ProjectDocs/contexts/ProjectContext.md` (User Roles and Permissions)

Key implementation decisions:
1. Used optimistic UI updates for enrollment actions
2. Implemented server-side validation of enrollment eligibility 
3. Added progress tracking as specified in context documents
```

## Context Maintenance

### Update Frequency

- **Project Context**: Update when significant project direction changes occur
- **Design Context**: Update when design system evolves or new patterns are established
- **Technical Context**: Update when architectural decisions change or new patterns emerge
- **Feature Context**: Update when feature requirements are refined or expanded

### Update Process

1. **Proposal**: Suggest updates via pull requests with clear rationale
2. **Review**: Have relevant stakeholders review proposed changes
3. **Approval**: Obtain consensus before merging changes
4. **Notification**: Communicate updates to the development team
5. **Version**: Update the version history table with a new entry

### Version Control

- Use version numbers (e.g., 1.0, 1.1) for major context documents
- Include dates and authors for all changes
- Maintain a detailed version history table
- Consider using git history for granular change tracking
