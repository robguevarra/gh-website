# Campaign Send Fix - Phase 1: Email Bounced NULL Handling

## Task Objective
Fix campaign sending issues related to email bounced status filtering and magic link generation for campaign emails.

## Current State Assessment
- Campaign send route was failing due to NULL email_bounced values being excluded
- Magic links were not being properly generated for campaign email recipients
- Email templates using {{magic_link}} variable were receiving empty or placeholder values

## Future State Goal
- All non-bounced profiles (including NULL email_bounced) should be included in campaigns
- Magic links should be dynamically generated for each email recipient during queue processing
- Email templates should receive properly formatted, functional magic links

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Fix NULL email_bounced filtering
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Updated campaign send route to include NULL email_bounced values
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Updated Edge Function check-frequency-limits to handle NULL values
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Tested campaign sending with NULL email_bounced profiles

### ✅ Step 2: Add magic_link variable to email system
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Added magic_link variable to ALL_EMAIL_VARIABLES in template-utils.ts
  - Added to Utility Links category with proper description and sample value
  - Set dataKey as 'magic_link' for template substitution
  
### ✅ Step 3: Implement magic link generation in email queue processing  
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Enhanced email queue processing in queue-utils.ts
  - Added magic link generation for each recipient during email processing
  - Integrated customer classification service to determine appropriate auth flow
  - Generated magic links with proper purpose and redirect paths
  - Added error handling with fallback placeholder values
  - Added magic_link to mergedVariables for template substitution

### ✅ Step 4: Test magic link functionality
- [x] **Task 4.1**: Test campaign sending with magic link templates
- [x] **Task 4.2**: Verify magic links are clickable and functional in emails
- [x] **Task 4.3**: Confirm proper authentication flow after clicking magic links

### ✅ Step 5: Create one-time migration solution for immediate fix
- [x] **Task 5.1**: Create migration API endpoint `/app/api/admin/campaigns/send-template-migration/route.ts`
  - Copies resend-welcome approach for magic link generation
  - Processes users in batches of 50 to avoid overwhelming system
  - Generates magic links per recipient using customer classification
  - Uses proper template variable substitution
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] **Task 5.2**: Create admin UI component `components/admin/template-migration.tsx`
  - Provides simple interface to run migration
  - Shows real-time batch processing progress
  - Displays success/error counts per batch
  - Includes template information and migration details
- [x] **Task 5.3**: Target "New Website Launch" template (ID: 3b292bfd-bec2-42ac-aa2c-97d3edd3501d)
  - Sends to all ~3,666 non-bounced users
  - Generates proper magic links with dashboard redirect
  - Uses customer classification for appropriate auth flows

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- `unified_profiles.email_bounced` is `BOOLEAN` with `IS_NULLABLE = YES` 
- Default value is `NULL`
- States: NULL (not bounced), false (not bounced), true (bounced)

### Code Changes Made
1. **API Routes**: Changed from `.eq('email_bounced', false)` to `.or('email_bounced.is.null,email_bounced.eq.false')`
2. **Frequency Capping**: Same filter logic update
3. **Edge Function**: Same filter logic update and proper deployment

### Files Modified
- `app/api/admin/campaigns/[id]/send/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/campaigns/send/route.ts` 
- `lib/email/frequency-capping.ts`
- `supabase/functions/check-frequency-limits/index.ts`

## Testing Status
- [X] Changes implemented and deployed
- [X] Migration tool created and tested successfully
- [X] Test email sent to robneil@gmail.com with proper magic link generation

### Migration Tool Test Results
- **Template**: "New Website Launch" (ID: 3b292bfd-bec2-42ac-aa2c-97d3edd3501d)
- **Test User**: robneil@gmail.com (email_bounced: null)
- **Result**: ✅ Email sent successfully with Message ID: 9dde18ec-8c67-4ab0-b8c9-d11dd87113ee
- **Magic Link**: ✅ Generated properly with account_setup purpose
- **Fixed Issue**: Email logging foreign key constraint error resolved by passing undefined leadId

### Step 6: Fix email logging for migration
- [x] **Task 6.1**: Fixed foreign key constraint error in email_send_log
  - Migration emails don't have purchase_leads association
  - Changed from passing profile.id to undefined for leadId parameter
  - Prevents "Key (lead_id) is not present in table purchase_leads" error

## Notes
- This was a critical bug affecting all campaign sending functionality
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Edge Function deployment required moving from nested directory structure
- Migration tool ready for production use with proper error handling
