# Email System Phase 2: Campaign Management

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive email campaign management system that leverages the existing segmentation functionality to enable targeted email campaigns, with features for creation, scheduling, delivery, and performance monitoring.

## Current State Assessment
The platform currently has a functional email infrastructure with Postmark integration, template management via Unlayer, and a recently completed user segmentation system. Users can create and manage email templates, and define user segments based on tags with complex logical operations. However, there is no way to create, schedule, or send email campaigns to these segments, nor track campaign-specific performance metrics.

## Future State Goal
A robust campaign management system that allows administrators to:
- Create email campaigns using existing templates
- Target specific user segments with campaigns
- Schedule campaigns with timezone support and recurring options
- Monitor campaign delivery and performance in real-time
- Implement A/B testing for campaign content optimization
- Ensure compliance with email marketing best practices and regulations

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed email system Phase 1 implementation
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Email template manager documentation
> 4. User segmentation system documentation
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Previously Completed Work
- **Email Templates**: The platform has a fully functional template management system using Unlayer editor
- **User Segmentation**: Recently completed system for creating and managing user segments based on tags
- **Email Analytics**: Basic email analytics are implemented, with both platform-wide and per-user views
- **Postmark Integration**: Email delivery is handled through Postmark with proper authentication

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our campaign management approach:
- **Mobile-first Design**: All interfaces must be responsive and work well on mobile devices
- **Functional Programming**: Use functional, declarative programming patterns (avoid OOP and classes)
- **DRY Principles**: Maintain code reusability and avoid duplication
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient database queries and UI rendering
