# Course Progress Tracking System: Phase 1 - Consistency Improvements

## Task Objective
Improve the consistency and reliability of the course progress tracking system by ensuring all components accurately reflect user progress across the platform.

## Current State Assessment
- The course progress system has several inconsistencies in how it loads and displays progress data.
- Lesson completion status is not shown correctly on initial loads in the CourseModuleAccordion.
- The CourseProgressSection may not be accurately counting completed lessons on the dashboard.
- Progress data is initialized without checking for existing progress, potentially resetting progress.

## Future State Goal
- All components display accurate, consistent progress information across the platform.
- Course and lesson progress is loaded correctly on initial page load without requiring user interaction.
- Components maintain data integrity by checking for existing progress before initializing.
- Single source of truth for progress data.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fix Course Module Accordion Progress Display ✓
- [x] Identify the root cause of lesson completion status not showing on initial load.
- [x] Implement a robust solution that shows completed lessons on initial load without requiring clicks.
- [x] Add verification through the database for lesson progress statuses.
- [x] Fix potential infinite loops in progress data loading.
- [x] Use a ref-based approach to track attempted progress loads.

### Step 2: Enhance Dashboard Progress Summary ✓
- [x] Analyze the CourseProgressSection component to ensure it correctly counts completed lessons.
- [x] Verify the data flow from the database to the dashboard UI.
- [x] Implement robust counting of completed lessons from the source of truth.
- [x] Add safeguards to prevent displaying incorrect "0%" when lessons are completed.
- [x] Ensure consistency between lesson completion indicators and progress percentages.

### Step 3: Standardize Progress Data Loading
- [ ] Create a unified approach to loading progress data across components.
- [ ] Implement a central mechanism to synchronize progress state across all components.
- [ ] Ensure real-time updates when lessons are marked as complete.
- [ ] Add proper loading states to prevent UI jarring during data fetching.

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- [x] Verify progress displays correctly on the course page.
- [x] Verify progress displays correctly on the dashboard.
- [ ] Test marking lessons as complete and ensuring all UI updates accordingly.
- [ ] Test course completion calculation.
- [ ] Verify that all components respect existing progress data.

### Step 5: Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Document the progress tracking system architecture.
- [ ] Add code comments explaining the progress calculation and loading mechanisms.
- [ ] Clean up any debug logging used during development.
- [ ] Create guidelines for future development of progress-related features.
