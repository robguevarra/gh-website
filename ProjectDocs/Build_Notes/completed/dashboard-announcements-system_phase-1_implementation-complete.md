# Dashboard Announcements System - Phase 1: Implementation Complete

## Task Objective
To replace the mock data for "Live Classes" and "Announcements" on the user dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) with a dynamic system. This system allows administrators to create, manage, and publish announcements (including live class schedules, sales, and general updates) via the admin dashboard.

## Current State Assessment
- ~~The user dashboard currently uses hardcoded arrays for "Live Classes" and "Announcements."~~ **COMPLETED**: Now using dynamic data from Supabase
- ~~There is no backend or admin interface to manage this content dynamically.~~ **COMPLETED**: Admin interface and API endpoints implemented
- ~~Admin access is controlled via the `checkAdminAccess` function, which verifies a `is_admin` flag in user metadata.~~ **IMPLEMENTED**: Security controls in place
- The Supabase project ID is `cidenjydokpzpsnpywcf`.

## Achieved State
- ✅ A new "Announcements" table in the Supabase database stores all types of announcements.
- ✅ CRUD API endpoints for managing announcements, secured for admin users.
- ✅ Admin dashboard section for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting announcements.
- ✅ User dashboard fetches and displays active, published announcements from the API.
- ✅ System supports different types of announcements (e.g., 'Live Class', 'Sale', 'General Update') with relevant fields for each.
- ✅ Dedicated dashboard announcements page (`/dashboard/announcements`) linked from the student header, displaying all published announcements in a user-friendly format.
- ✅ Carousel feature in the dashboard that automatically cycles through announcements every 8 seconds.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)
- ✅ Created `announcements` table with all planned fields:
  - Standard fields: `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `title`, `content`
  - Type and status fields: `type`, `status`
  - Timing fields: `publish_date`, `expiry_date`
  - Link fields: `link_url`, `link_text`
  - Media fields: `image_url`
  - Host fields: `host_name`, `host_avatar_url`
  - Organization fields: `target_audience`, `sort_order`
- ✅ Implemented indexes for efficient querying
- ✅ Set up RLS policies for proper access control

### 2. API Endpoints
- ✅ **Admin Endpoints** (`/api/admin/announcements`):
  - All CRUD operations implemented with proper authentication
  - Pagination and filtering support added
  - Zod validation schemas implemented
- ✅ **Public Endpoint** (`/api/announcements`):
  - Fetches published announcements with proper filtering
  - Supports pagination with `?page=1&limit=10` parameters
  - Handles different announcement types appropriately

### 3. Admin Dashboard UI
- ✅ Created announcement management section with:
  - List view with filtering and pagination
  - Create/Edit form with appropriate input types
  - Delete functionality with confirmation
  - Preview capabilities

### 4. User Dashboard Integration
- ✅ Replaced mock data with dynamic announcements from the database
- ✅ Implemented carousel feature that automatically cycles through announcements every 8 seconds
- ✅ Added indicator dots for manual navigation between announcements
- ✅ Improved animation with smooth horizontal sliding transitions
- ✅ Ensured proper handling of different announcement types

### 5. Announcements Page
- ✅ Created a dedicated `/dashboard/announcements` page accessible only to logged-in members
- ✅ Implemented tabs to filter announcements by type (All, Live Classes, Store Sales, New Content)
- ✅ Designed elegant cards for each announcement type with appropriate visual styling
- ✅ Added empty states for when no announcements are available
- ✅ Implemented pagination for navigating through announcements

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Aligned all components with the Graceful Homeschooling design system
- ✅ Used consistent color schemes based on announcement types:
  - Live Classes: Brand Pink
  - Store Sales: Brand Purple
  - New Content: Brand Blue
  - General Updates: Green
- ✅ Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Added subtle animations for a more engaging user experience
- ✅ Removed unused notification feature from the student header
- ✅ Updated student header navigation to point to the new announcements page

## Recent Bug Fixes

### Live Class Announcements Visibility Issue
- **Issue**: Live class announcements were visible to admin users but not to regular users
- **Root Cause**: The query logic in the public API endpoint had a complex OR condition that wasn't properly filtering live_class announcements
- **Solution**: Refactored the query to use clearer logic:
  - For non-live_class announcements: Show if publish_date is in the past or null
  - For live_class announcements: Show if publish_date is in the future (upcoming classes)
  - For all announcements: Only show if they haven't expired

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- Consider adding a "Featured" flag to highlight important announcements
- For live classes, consider adding fields for "duration" and "location"
- Explore integration with calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal) for live classes
- Implement advanced targeting based on user segments
- Add analytics to track announcement engagement
- Implement A/B testing capabilities for announcement content

## Conclusion
The announcements system has been successfully implemented and meets all the requirements outlined in the initial plan. The system provides a flexible and user-friendly way to communicate with users through various types of announcements. The dashboard integration with the carousel feature enhances the user experience by showcasing important announcements without taking up too much space.

The implementation follows the project's design principles of warmth, elegance, clarity, and support, creating a cohesive and visually appealing user experience that aligns with the overall brand identity of Graceful Homeschooling.
