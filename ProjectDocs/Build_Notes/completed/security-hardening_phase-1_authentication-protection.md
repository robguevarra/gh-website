# Security Hardening: Authentication Protection (Task 2.6)

## Task Objective
Implement comprehensive security hardening measures for the authentication system to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Current State Assessment
The application currently uses Supabase Auth with PKCE flow for authentication. The system has basic authentication workflows in place, including:
- User authentication via email/password and social providers
- Multi-role user identification via boolean flags in the `unified_profiles` table
- Role-based navigation between different portals (student, affiliate, admin)
- Basic middleware for session validation and role-based access control

However, the system lacks advanced security measures such as rate limiting, optimized JWT configuration, CSRF protection, secure cookie handling, and suspicious activity detection.

## Future State Goal
A robust authentication system with industry-standard security measures including:
- Rate limiting for authentication-related endpoints
- Optimized JWT configuration with appropriate expiration times
- CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Secure cookie handling with proper flags
- IP-based suspicious activity detection
- Security headers for browser protection
- Comprehensive security testing

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Security Middleware Infrastructure
- [ ] Create a middleware directory for security-related middleware
- [ ] Implement a middleware composition pattern for applying multiple security measures
- [ ] Set up logging for security events

### 2. Implement Rate Limiting
- [ ] Create a rate limiting middleware for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement in-memory rate limiting solution (with Redis support as an option)
- [ ] Apply rate limiting to login, signup, password reset, and OTP endpoints
- [ ] Add frontend retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement user feedback for rate-limited actions

### 3. Optimize JWT & Session Security
- [ ] Review and configure Supabase JWT settings
- [ ] Set appropriate token expiration times
- [ ] Implement JWT refresh logic
- [ ] Add session listing and termination capabilities
- [ ] Create mechanism for forced logout on suspicious activity

### 4. Implement CSRF Protection
- [ ] Add CSRF token generation and validation
- [ ] Implement token rotation and expiration
- [ ] Apply CSRF protection to all state-changing operations

### 5. Enhance Cookie Security
- [ ] Configure secure cookie flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
- [ ] Implement cookie prefixing
- [ ] Set appropriate cookie expiration and scope

### 6. Add Suspicious Activity Detection
- [ ] Enhance logging for authentication events
- [ ] Implement IP-based tracking for login attempts
- [ ] Create a suspicious activity detection system
- [ ] Develop notification system for suspicious logins
- [ ] Implement account lockdown procedures for high-risk scenarios

### 7. Configure Security Headers
- [ ] Implement Content-Security-Policy headers
- [ ] Add X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers
- [ ] Configure appropriate CORS policies
- [ ] Implement Feature-Policy/Permissions-Policy headers
- [ ] Configure Referrer-Policy for privacy protection
- [ ] Add HSTS headers for enforcing HTTPS

### 8. Conduct Security Testing
- [ ] Create security-focused test suite
- [ ] Test for common web security issues (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Conduct code review focused on security best practices
- [ ] Verify proper implementation of all security measures
