# Student Affiliate Application Wizard - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a 6-step affiliate application wizard within the existing student dashboard that allows students to apply to become affiliates with automated role assignment and "Course Enrollee Tier" membership level assignment.

## Current State Assessment
- Student dashboard exists with comprehensive layout and navigation
- Separate affiliate signup flow exists for new users at `/auth/affiliate-signup`
- Affiliate portal exists at `/affiliate-portal/` with complete functionality
- GCash payment integration exists with validation and forms
- Membership tier system exists with "Course Enrollee Tier" at 25% commission
- Existing wizard patterns in `WelcomeModal` and `CheckoutModal` components
- Supabase Auth with role-based access control via `unified_profiles` table

## Future State Goal
- Students can apply to become affiliates directly from their dashboard
- 6-step wizard modal with:
  1. Explain affiliate program
  2. Terms and conditions
  3. Agreement confirmation
  4. Add GCash payment details
  5. Show payment information
  6. Final confirmation with liability disclaimers
- Automatic role assignment and membership tier assignment
- "Application pending" status display after completion
- Full integration with existing codebase patterns
