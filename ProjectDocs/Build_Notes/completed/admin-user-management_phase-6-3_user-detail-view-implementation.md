# Admin User Management - Phase 6-3: User Detail View Implementation

## Task Objective
Develop a comprehensive user detail view at `/admin/users/[id]` that provides administrators with a complete picture of individual user data, including profile information, purchase history, enrollment details, and engagement metrics, along with the ability to manage these aspects.

## Current State Assessment
The user list view implemented in Phase 6-2 now allows administrators to browse and find users, but there is no detailed view to examine and manage individual user accounts. The enhanced database schema from Phase 6-1 contains all the necessary data, but no interface exists to present this information in a cohesive and actionable format.

## Future State Goal
A fully-featured user detail view that:

1. **Presents complete user information**: Displays all relevant user data in a well-organized interface
2. **Offers tabbed navigation**: Separates different aspects of user data into logical sections
3. **Enables direct editing**: Allows administrators to modify user profile information
4. **Shows comprehensive history**: Presents purchase history and enrollment details
5. **Visualizes engagement**: Displays user activity and engagement metrics
6. **Provides management tools**: Offers administrative actions for account management

## Implementation Plan

  - Add error handling for data fetch failures
- [ ] Design responsive layout
  - Create responsive page layout with header and tabs
  - Implement collapsible sections for mobile
  - Use grid/flex layouts for optimal space utilization

### 2. Profile Information Section

  - Create link to related order management
  - Add refund/credit capabilities if applicable

### 4. Enrollment Management Section
- [ ] Build enrollment overview
  - Create visual summary of enrollment status
  - Show active, completed, and expired enrollments
  - Implement progress metrics for current enrollments
- [ ] Design detailed enrollment listings
  - Display course details with enrollment dates
  - Show progress and completion indicators
  - Include access expiration information
- [ ] Implement enrollment controls
  - Add ability to extend enrollment periods
  - Create functionality to grant additional access

  - Implement filtering by activity type
  - Show login history and session information
- [ ] Build engagement visualizations
  - Create charts for content access patterns
  - Implement progress visualization across courses
  - Design engagement score trends over time
- [ ] Add administrative insights
  - Highlight unusual activity patterns
  - Calculate and display retention metrics
  - Show comparative engagement against user cohort

### 6. Administrative Controls
- [ ] Implement account management
  - Create interface for password reset initiation
  - Add account suspension/reactivation controls
  - Implement access level management
- [ ] Build specialized tools
  - Add email communication capability
  - Implement manual data synchronization tools
  - Create account verification controls
- [ ] Develop audit logging
  - Display history of administrative actions
  - Show before/after states for changes
  - Include admin attribution for all actions

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Use tab-based lazy loading to improve initial load time
- Implement staggered data fetching for non-critical information
- Consider client-side caching for frequently accessed data

### Security and Privacy
- Ensure proper authentication for all administrative actions
- Implement confirmation workflows for critical operations
- Add audit logging for all user data modifications

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigability throughout the interface
- Implement proper focus management between tabs
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for custom components

### UX Considerations
- Design clear visual hierarchy for complex information
- Implement intuitive editing workflows
- Provide contextual help for administrative functions

## Completion Criteria
This phase will be considered complete when:

1. User detail view is fully implemented with all planned features
2. Profile editing functionality works correctly
3. Purchase history and enrollment details are properly displayed
4. Activity tracking provides meaningful insights
5. Administrative controls function as expected
6. The interface is responsive across all device sizes
7. Accessibility standards are met

## Next Steps After Completion
Proceed with **Phase 6-4: User Account Reconciliation and Data Synchronization**, building specialized tools for managing user data across different systems and ensuring data consistency.
