# Platform Integration - Phase 1-3: Database Schema Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement the core database schema in Supabase to support user authentication, course management, membership capabilities, payment tracking, email marketing, and comprehensive access control for the Graceful Homeschooling platform.

## Current State Assessment
The architecture planning (Phase 1-1) and infrastructure planning (Phase 1-2) are complete. Currently, we've created the SQL migration files for all required tables, but they haven't been applied to the Supabase database yet.

## Future State Goal
A fully implemented database schema in Supabase with proper tables, relationships, and row-level security policies that will support all platform functionality including user management, course delivery, membership features, payment processing, email marketing, and granular access controls.

## Relevant Context

### Design Principles
- **Functional & Declarative**: Structure database for functional data operations following project-wide functional programming approach
- **Modularity**: Create clear table separations with well-defined relationships to support maximum file size of 150 lines
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensure database schema generates accurate TypeScript types for type safety
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming patterns for tables and columns

### Architectural Decisions
- **User Management Architecture**
  - Core user table leverages Supabase Auth with extension for profile data
  - Separate profiles table for extensible user information beyond auth
  - Many-to-many relationships through junction tables (user_courses)
  - Role-based access control through dedicated roles field with hierarchical permissions

- **Content Structure Architecture**
  - Three-tier content hierarchy: Courses → Modules → Lessons
  - Content metadata separation from delivery mechanism
  - Media assets referenced through URLs rather than stored directly
  - Tagging system for cross-referencing and categorization

- **Access Control Architecture**
  - Membership tiers defined in dedicated table with access rights
  - Time-based access through start/end date fields
  - Row-level security policies in Supabase for data protection
  - Special access grants for promotional or limited-time access
  - Granular permission system with role-based capabilities

- **Payment Processing Architecture**
  - Transaction records linked to users and purchases
  - Subscription payment tracking with renewal information
  - Invoice and receipt generation capability
  - Payment status tracking and history

- **Email Marketing Architecture**
  - Template-based email design system
  - Campaign tracking and management
  - Automated sequences based on user actions
  - Segmentation and targeting capabilities

- **Data Relationships Overview**
  - User → Enrollments → Courses (many-to-many)
  - Courses → Modules → Lessons (one-to-many hierarchical)
  - Users → Subscriptions → Membership Tiers
  - Users → Transactions → Products/Courses
  - Users → Progress → Lessons
  - Campaigns → Email Templates → Sends → Users

### Technical Requirements
- Use Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database implementation
- Implement row-level security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Follow the schema specifications from infrastructure planning
- Create proper indexes for performance optimization
- Ensure schema supports Next.js 15+ with App Router and React Server Components
- Design schema to work efficiently with server-side data fetching

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Setup
- [x] Create SQL migration files for user management tables (profiles, membership_tiers, user_memberships)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for course content tables (courses, modules, lessons, user_enrollments, user_progress)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for payment and transaction tables (transactions, payment_methods)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for email marketing tables (email_templates, email_campaigns, etc.)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for permissions and access control tables (roles, permissions, etc.)
- [x] Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to control access
- [x] Create helper scripts for applying migrations
- [x] Apply migrations to Supabase database
- [x] Verify table creation and RLS policies

### 2. TypeScript Integration
- [x] Create database client utility functions (`lib/supabase/client.ts`)
- [x] Create data access functions for common database operations (`lib/supabase/data-access.ts`)
- [x] Create React hooks for client-side data access (`lib/supabase/hooks.ts`)
- [x] Create authentication utilities (`lib/supabase/auth.ts`)
- [x] Create authentication context provider (`context/auth-context.tsx`)
- [x] Set up middleware for authentication (`middleware.ts`)
- [x] Create Supabase provider component (`components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx`)
- [x] Create an admin user creation utility (`lib/supabase/admin-setup.ts` and `scripts/create-admin.ts`)

### 3. Documentation
- [x] Document database schema in README.md
- [x] Document TypeScript integration and usage

### Next Steps
- Test authentication flow
- Implement UI components for authentication (login, signup, etc.)
- Create admin dashboard for database management
- Implement course creation and management functionality

## Implementation Approach
1. Create a Supabase migration script for each logical group of tables
   - User management tables
   - Course content tables
   - Payment and transaction tables
   - Email marketing tables
   - Permissions and access control tables
   - Additional functionality tables
2. Implement tables in order of dependencies
   - Start with tables that have no foreign key dependencies
   - Add tables with dependencies after their referenced tables exist
3. Add sample data for testing after each group of tables is created
4. Implement and test RLS policies immediately after creating each table
5. Generate TypeScript types after schema is complete and verified
6. Document the schema with relationship diagrams for future reference

## Design Considerations
- Ensure all tables follow the Graceful Homeschooling design principles of clarity and elegance
- Design database to support the mobile-first approach outlined in the design context
- Structure data to facilitate the creation of accessible and responsive interfaces
- Consider future extensibility when designing schema

## Next Steps After Completion
Once the database schema is implemented and verified, we will proceed to Phase 1-4: Authentication System Implementation, which will build upon this database foundation.
