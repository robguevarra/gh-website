# Database Schema Implementation for Phases 1-3

## Task Objective
Implement the database schema for the Graceful Homeschooling platform, covering user management, course content, payment processing, email marketing, and permissions/access control.

## Current State Assessment
The project has a defined database schema design from Phases 1-2 but lacks implementation in Supabase.

## Future State Goal
A fully implemented database schema in Supabase with proper TypeScript integration, including all necessary tables, relationships, and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Setup
- [x] Create SQL migration files for user management tables (profiles, membership_tiers, user_memberships)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for course content tables (courses, modules, lessons, user_enrollments, user_progress)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for payment and transaction tables (transactions, payment_methods)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for email marketing tables (email_templates, email_campaigns, etc.)
- [x] Create SQL migration files for permissions and access control tables (roles, permissions, etc.)
- [x] Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to control access
- [x] Create helper scripts for applying migrations
- [x] Apply migrations to Supabase database
- [x] Verify table creation and RLS policies

### 2. TypeScript Integration
- [x] Create database client utility functions (`lib/supabase/client.ts`)
- [x] Create data access functions for common database operations (`lib/supabase/data-access.ts`)
- [x] Create React hooks for client-side data access (`lib/supabase/hooks.ts`)
- [x] Create authentication utilities (`lib/supabase/auth.ts`)
- [x] Create authentication context provider (`context/auth-context.tsx`)
- [x] Set up middleware for authentication (`middleware.ts`)
- [x] Create Supabase provider component (`components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx`)
- [x] Create an admin user creation utility (`lib/supabase/admin-setup.ts` and `scripts/create-admin.ts`)

### 3. Documentation
- [x] Document database schema in README.md
- [x] Document TypeScript integration and usage

### Next Steps
- Test authentication flow
- Implement UI components for authentication (login, signup, etc.)
- Create admin dashboard for database management
- Implement course creation and management functionality

## Implementation Approach
The implementation follows a modular approach, with separate SQL migration files for each logical group of tables. We're using Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data security and proper access control based on user roles.

The TypeScript integration provides reusable hooks and utilities for data access, making it easy to interact with the database from both server and client components.

## Completion Criteria
- All database tables created in Supabase
- RLS policies properly implemented for all tables
- TypeScript integration complete with data access functions and hooks
- Documentation available in README.md and TYPESCRIPT.md
- Admin user creation utility available for initial setup
