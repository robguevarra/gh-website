# Course Enrollment Management - Phase 2: Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive course enrollment management system that allows administrators to view, add, update, and delete student enrollments in courses.

## Current State Assessment
The platform had a unified course editor with tabs for managing course information, modules, and lessons. However, there was no way for administrators to manage student enrollments directly from the course management interface.

## Future State Goal
A fully integrated enrollment management system within the course editor that allows administrators to:
1. View all enrollments for a course with pagination and filtering
2. Add new enrollments by searching for users
3. Update enrollment status (active, suspended, cancelled)
4. Set and modify enrollment expiration dates
5. Delete enrollments when necessary
