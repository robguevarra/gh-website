# Affiliate Click Tracking - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a complete affiliate click tracking and attribution system with a JavaScript pixel that sets cookies, handles UTM parameters, and reliably tracks affiliate referrals for proper commission attribution.

## Current State Assessment
The affiliate program database schema has been established with the necessary `affiliate_clicks` table, but no actual tracking mechanisms exist. Currently, there is no way to attribute website visits to specific affiliates, track conversion paths, or implement last-click-wins attribution. The affiliate program functionality is incomplete without this crucial tracking capability.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional affiliate click tracking system that:
- Records all affiliate-referred traffic in the database
- Provides reliable 30-day attribution via cookies
- Handles UTM parameters for tracking campaigns
- Implements last-click-wins attribution logic
- Generates and maintains visitor IDs for cross-session tracking
- Collects necessary metadata while respecting privacy regulations
- Functions with minimal performance impact on the website

  - Sanitize incoming data to prevent SQL injection
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 2. Develop JavaScript Tracking Pixel
- [x] Create core pixel functionality
  - Design lightweight, non-blocking script structure
  - Implement asynchronous loading pattern
  - Add script error handling and fallbacks
- [x] Implement tracking request generation
  - Create both image and fetch-based request methods
  - Add retry logic for failed requests
  - Implement queuing for offline functionality
- [x] Develop embed code generator
  - Create simple snippet for website integration
  - Design self-contained script with no dependencies
  - Make pixel configurable for different tracking needs
- [x] Add debug mode
  - Implement console logging for development
  - Create visual indicators for successful tracking
  - Add payload inspection capabilities

### 3. Implement Cookie Management and UTM Parameter Handling
- [x] Develop cookie setting mechanism
  - Implement secure, HttpOnly cookie generation
  - Set appropriate 30-day expiration
  - Add domain scoping for proper tracking
- [x] Create UTM parameter handling
  - Parse `?a=<slug>` and other UTM parameters
  - Implement parameter validation and sanitization
  - Store UTM data in cookies and database
- [x] Implement last-click-wins attribution
  - Design cookie overwriting logic
  - Add timestamp comparison for attribution decisions
  - Implement attribution chain tracking
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms
  - Develop localStorage fallback for cookie-less environments
  - Implement URL-based session tracking as last resort
  - Add fingerprinting options for improved tracking reliability

### 4. Develop Visitor ID Generation and Session Tracking
- [x] Design visitor ID system
  - Create secure, unique ID generation algorithm
  - Implement collision prevention mechanisms
  - Set up persistence across sessions
- [x] Implement session tracking
  - Define session boundaries and timeout rules
  - Create session grouping of user activities
  - Track session duration and interaction counts
- [x] Develop cross-domain tracking
  - Implement first-party cookie storage
  - Create postMessage API for cross-domain communication
  - Add URL parameter passing for domain transitions
- [x] Ensure privacy compliance
  - Implement consent mechanisms for tracking
  - Create anonymization options for sensitive data
  - Add data retention policies and automation

### 5. Optimize Performance and Conduct Testing
- [x] Implement performance optimizations
  - Add request batching for multiple events
  - Implement lazy loading of non-critical components
  - Optimize cookie and localStorage access patterns
- [x] Develop comprehensive testing suite
  - Create unit tests for all components
  - Implement integration tests for the full tracking flow
  - Add browser compatibility tests
- [x] Conduct load testing
  - Simulate high-volume tracking scenarios
  - Test database performance under load
  - Identify and resolve bottlenecks
- [x] Document performance metrics
  - Measure and document pixel load time
  - Track server-side processing time
  - Monitor database write performance

## Technical Considerations

### Database Scalability
- The `affiliate_clicks` table needs to handle high write volumes
- Consider adding partitioning for improved performance
- Implement proper indexing for affiliate_id and visitor_id columns
- Plan for regular archiving of older tracking data

### Privacy Requirements
- Store IP addresses in a privacy-compliant way (hashing/truncating)
- Implement proper consent management for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Create data retention policies that balance business needs with privacy
- Document all tracking in the privacy policy

### Performance Impact
- The tracking pixel must not impact page load performance
- Target p95 load time of â‰¤ 200ms for the pixel
- Implement requestIdleCallback for non-critical operations
- Use passive event listeners to avoid blocking the main thread

### Security Considerations
- Protect against CSRF attacks in the tracking endpoint
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all affiliate slugs against the database
- Use secure, HttpOnly cookies with appropriate flags

## Completion Status

This phase is now complete. We have implemented the core affiliate click tracking components and resolved all identified issues:

1. **API Endpoint Implementation**: Created `/api/affiliate/click` to handle tracking requests, validate affiliates, and record clicks in the database. Fixed issues with landing page URL recording by properly capturing the actual page URL.

2. **JavaScript Tracking Pixel**: Developed a lightweight, non-blocking direct fetch implementation that handles affiliate parameter detection, UTM parameter tracking, and proper attribution. Simplified from external script approach to improve reliability.

3. **React Component**: Built a `GlobalAffiliateTracker` client component for site-wide tracking integration in the Next.js App Router framework.

4. **Visitor ID System**: Implemented cookie-based visitor identification with 30-day persistence for affiliate attribution.

5. **UTM Parameter Handling**: Added comprehensive support for storing UTM parameters as JSONB in the database for marketing attribution.

6. **Database Schema Optimization**: Added necessary fields to the `affiliate_clicks` table including `utm_params`, `user_agent_details`, and `landing_page_url`.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Removed debug logging from production code while maintaining the ability to enable it when needed.

Challenges addressed:
- Fixed URL encoding issues that prevented proper affiliate parameter detection
- Resolved landing page URL recording to capture the actual page visited instead of the API endpoint
- Implemented proper UTM parameter storage in the database
- Ensured cookie setting works correctly across the site
- Optimized production code by removing verbose debug logging

## Next Steps After Completion
After implementing the click tracking system, we will move on to developing the conversion tracking system that ties purchases and other valuable actions back to the original affiliate referral.
