# Platform Integration - Phase 1-6: Project Structure

## Task Objective
Establish consistent project structure, coding patterns, and documentation standards for the Graceful Homeschooling platform to ensure maintainability, scalability, and developer efficiency as we progress to more advanced features in later phases.

## Current State Assessment
The platform now has several key components implemented including database schema, authentication, and basic admin interface. However, as the project grows, there's a need to formalize the project structure, establish coding conventions, and document patterns for consistency across all future development efforts.

## Future State Goal
A well-organized codebase with clear folder structures, standardized naming conventions, consistent coding patterns, comprehensive documentation, and reusable component libraries that will serve as the foundation for all future development phases.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note or future build notes, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes (Phase 1-0 through Phase 1-5)
> 2. Implementation strategy (`platform-integration_phase1-0_implementation-strategy.md`)
> 3. Architecture planning (`platform-integration_phase1-1_architecture-planning.md`)
> 4. Infrastructure planning (`platform-integration_phase1-2_infrastructure-planning.md`) 
> 5. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 6. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our project structure approach:
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router, React Server Components, and SSR capabilities
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Zustand, Framer Motion, Supabase
- **Development Standards**: 
  - Mobile-first approach and responsive design
  - Functional, declarative programming (no OOP or classes)
  - Maximum file size of 150 lines
  - Semantic variable naming with auxiliary verbs
  - Server-side logic emphasized (minimal `use client` usage)
  - PWA structure with offline capabilities

### From Design Context
From the `designContext.md`, the following key points influence our project structure:
- **Color System**: Consistent application of primary, secondary, and accent colors with neutral palette
- **Typography**: Inter for body text and UI, Playfair Display for headings
- **Component Patterns**: Consistent patterns for buttons, cards, forms, navigation, etc.
- **Animation Principles**: Subtle animations with natural easing and appropriate timing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with optimized layouts for different screen sizes

### From Architecture Planning
From the `platform-integration_phase1-1_architecture-planning.md`, the following structural considerations apply:
- **Component Architecture**: Atomic design pattern with server/client component separation
- **Styling Architecture**: TailwindCSS with design system extension
- **Frontend Integration**: Clear navigation structure, consistent styling, responsive designs

### From Infrastructure Planning
From the `platform-integration_phase1-2_infrastructure-planning.md`, the following technical decisions apply:
- **Component structure**: Plan atomic design implementation with component hierarchy
- **State management**: Define server vs. client state separation
- **Route structure**: Define URL structure and navigation flow

### From Previously Completed Phases
The project has already completed:
- **Phase 1-3**: Database Schema Implementation
- **Phase 1-4**: Authentication System Implementation
- **Phase 1-5**: Basic Admin Interface

These implementations have established initial patterns that should be formalized and expanded upon in this phase.
