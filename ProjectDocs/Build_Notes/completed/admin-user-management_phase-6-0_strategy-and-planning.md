# Admin User Management - Phase 6-0: Strategy and Planning

## Task Objective
Develop a comprehensive admin user management system for Graceful Homeschooling that enables administrators to efficiently view, manage and analyze user data, enrollment details, and purchase history. This will provide a central hub for user administration that follows industry best practices for SaaS platforms.

## Current State Assessment
The platform currently has an admin section (`/admin`) with a sidebar navigation that includes a "Users" link, but no implementation for user management functionality exists. User data is distributed across several tables:

- `unified_profiles`: Contains core user data from our unified data model
- `enrollments`: Contains course enrollment data for users
- `shopify_orders` and `shopify_order_items`: Current purchase data with Shopify as PIM
- `shopify_products`: Product information from Shopify
- Future tables `ecommerce_orders` and `ecommerce_order_items`: Will contain purchase data as we migrate from Shopify to our custom storefront

The admin dashboard has other sections for analytics and revenue tracking, but lacks comprehensive user management capabilities that would allow administrators to view user details, manage their accounts, and track their engagement across the platform.

## Future State Goal
A fully-featured admin user management system with:

1. **User Overview**: A comprehensive list view of all users with search, filter, and sort capabilities by key attributes (name, email, enrollment status, etc.)
2. **User Detail View**: Individual user profiles showing complete information including:
   - Personal details (name, email, contact information)
   - Enrollment history and current enrollment status
   - Purchase history with detailed transaction information
   - Engagement metrics and activity logs
3. **User Management Actions**: Ability for administrators to:
   - Edit user details and profile information
   - Manage user access levels and permissions
   - Grant or revoke access to specific content or features
   - Handle account exceptions (extend enrollments, issue refunds, etc.)
4. **User Analytics**: Visualizations and insights about:
   - User acquisition trends
   - Purchase patterns and revenue per user
   - Engagement metrics and content consumption
5. **Export & Reporting**: Generate and export user reports for business intelligence purposes

The system will follow industry best practices for SaaS platforms regarding user privacy, data security, audit logging, and intuitive UX for administrators.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Data Unification Strategy (Phase 3-0) - Defined `unified_profiles` structure
> 2. Shopify E-commerce Integration (Phase 5-0) - Defined product/order data structures
> 3. Project Context (`projectContext.md`) - Defines tech stack, goals, and standards
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
- Tech Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC), Supabase, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- Development Standards: Mobile-first, functional programming, server-side logic preferred
- Goal: Create an award-winning platform with seamless user experiences

### From Data Unification (Phase 3-0)
- Unified user profile structure in `unified_profiles` table
- Email normalization standards (lowercase, trim)
- Unified status field mappings
- Relationships between profiles, payments, and enrollments

### From Shopify E-commerce Integration (Phase 5-0)
- Shopify as PIM (Product Information Management) system
- Transaction data stored in Supabase for unified reporting
- Future migration to `ecommerce_orders` table structure

## Implementation Plan
