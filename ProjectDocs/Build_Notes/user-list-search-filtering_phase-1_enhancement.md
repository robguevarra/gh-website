# User List Search, Filtering and Sorting - Phase 1: Enhancement

## Task Objective
Enhance the existing user list with more robust search capabilities, advanced filtering, and column sorting functionality.

## Current State Assessment
The user list already has basic search and filtering capabilities:
- Basic search input that filters by search term
- Filter by status (active, inactive, pending, etc.)
- Filter by acquisition source
- Filter by transaction and enrollment status
- Date-based filtering (created after/before)
- URL-based filter parameters for shareable links

However, the current implementation lacks:
- Column sorting functionality
- Visual indicators for sort direction
- Advanced combination filtering
- Optimized search performance
- Clear visual feedback for active filters

## Future State Goal
A comprehensive user list with advanced search, filtering, and sorting capabilities that allow administrators to quickly find and manage users through:
- Enhanced search with typeahead suggestions
- Multi-attribute filtering with intuitive UI
- Column sorting with clear visual indicators
- Optimized performance for large datasets
- URL-based parameters for all filters and sorts

## Implementation Plan

1. Enhance Search Functionality
   - [x] Improve search input with clear button functionality
   - [ ] Add ability to search by specific fields (email, name, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement search history for quick access to previous searches
   - [x] Add clear search button with visual feedback

2. Implement Column Sorting
   - [x] Add sort functionality to all relevant columns
   - [x] Implement visual indicators for sort direction (ascending/descending)
   - [x] Ensure sort state is reflected in URL parameters
   - [ ] Support multi-column sorting (primary, secondary sort)

3. Enhance Filtering UI
   - [x] Redesign filter UI for better usability
   - [ ] Add filter combinations (AND/OR logic)
   - [ ] Implement filter presets for common queries
   - [ ] Add filter history and indicators for active filters

4. Optimize Performance
   - [ ] Implement server-side sorting and filtering
   - [ ] Add pagination improvements
   - [ ] Optimize data fetching with selective loading
   - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data

5. Improve User Experience
   - [x] Add toggle functionality for filter visibility
   - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - [ ] Add tooltips for complex filter options
   - [x] Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes of filters and table

## Technical Details

### Search Enhancements
- Implement debounced search using useDebounce hook
- Add search by field using format: "field:value" (e.g., "email:john@example.com")
- Enhance search backend to support partial matching and fuzzy search

### Sorting Implementation
- Add sort parameters to URL using format: "sort=field:direction" (e.g., "sort=name:asc")
- Implement sort indicators using arrow icons in table headers
- Support multi-column sorting with primary and secondary sort fields

### Filter Improvements
- Enhance filter UI with collapsible sections for different filter categories
- Add filter combinations using AND/OR logic
- Implement filter presets for common scenarios (e.g., "Active users with purchases")

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement server-side sorting and filtering to reduce client-side processing
- Add selective loading of columns to reduce data transfer
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Dependencies
- React Hook Form for advanced filter forms
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Next.js App Router for URL-based parameters
- Supabase for server-side filtering and sorting
