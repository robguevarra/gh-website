# Postmark Email Integration - Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive email delivery system using Postmark for Graceful Homeschooling's transactional emails, marketing campaigns, and educational content delivery.

## Current State Assessment
We have implemented a Postmark-based email delivery system, including transactional emails, marketing campaign capabilities, and educational content delivery. The system is integrated with Supabase Auth. We've successfully simplified our approach by eliminating MJML completely and using clean, responsive HTML directly.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional email system integrated with Postmark, featuring:
- Reliable transactional email delivery (welcome, password reset)
- Batch processing for marketing campaigns and class reminders
- Template-based emails matching the Graceful Homeschooling design system
- Multiple email categories (authentication, marketing, educational)
- Visual template editor for non-technical admins
- User segmentation via tags
- Detailed engagement analytics
