# Course Editor Enhancements - Phase 2

## Task Objective
Enhance the course editor with autosave functionality, media upload capabilities, and course preview features while ensuring proper integration with the admin interface.

## Current State Assessment
- New course editor implementation exists but old implementation still in place
- TipTap editor implemented but lacks media upload functionality
- Manual save required for all changes
- Course preview functionality is basic
- Several old admin components still present and causing build errors

## Future State Goal
- Single, unified course editor with autosave
- Rich media upload capabilities integrated with TipTap
- Enhanced course preview functionality
- Clean removal of old editor implementation
- Clean and organized admin component structure

## Implementation Plan

1. Clean Up Old Implementation
   - [x] Remove old course editor components
   - [x] Update routing to use new editor exclusively
   - [x] Clean up any unused dependencies
   - [ ] Remove old module-editor.tsx
   - [ ] Remove old lesson-editor.tsx
   - [ ] Remove old rich-text-editor.tsx
   - [ ] Update admin component imports in documentation
   - [ ] Verify no remaining references to old components

2. Implement Autosave
   - [x] Add debounced save functionality to ContentEditor
   - [x] Implement save indicators (saving, saved, error states)
   - [x] Add error handling and recovery
   - [x] Ensure autosave works for all content types (course, module, lesson)

3. Enhance Media Upload
   - [x] Implement Supabase storage integration
   - [x] Add image upload functionality to TipTap
   - [x] Add drag-and-drop support for media
   - [x] Add progress indicators for uploads

4. Improve Course Preview
   - [x] Enhance preview component with more detailed rendering
   - [x] Add live preview updates
   - [x] Implement preview in new tab functionality
   - [x] Add mobile/desktop preview toggle

5. Testing & Validation
   - [x] Initial test of autosave functionality
   - [ ] Fix identified autosave issues:
     * [BLOCKER] Lesson updates not persisting in database
     * [BLOCKER] Content not updating when switching between lessons
     * [ISSUE] Authentication flow needs improvement
     * [ISSUE] Error handling could be more informative
   - [ ] Validate media upload features
   - [ ] Verify preview functionality
   - [ ] Ensure clean routing and navigation
   - [ ] Test build process after component cleanup
   - [ ] Comprehensive testing after fixes:
     * Test concurrent edits
     * Verify state synchronization
     * Check authentication persistence
     * Validate error recovery
     * Test network error scenarios

## Implementation Notes

1. Autosave Implementation:
   - Added debounced save functionality with 1-second delay
   - Implemented visual feedback for save states (saving, saved, error)
   - Added error handling with user-friendly messages
   - [ISSUE] Initial implementation had authentication issues
   - [ATTEMPTED FIX] Updated route handler to use createRouteHandlerClient
   - [ATTEMPTED FIX] Added service role client for database operations
   - [ATTEMPTED FIX] Added credentials: 'include' to fetch requests
   - [ATTEMPTED FIX] Improved error handling in course store
   - [ATTEMPTED FIX] Added schema validation for lesson and module updates
   - [ISSUE] Still experiencing issues with lesson updates not persisting
   - [NEXT STEPS] Need to investigate:
     * Database transaction handling
     * State synchronization between client and server
     * Potential race conditions in save operations
     * Session management and cookie handling

2. Media Upload Features:
   - Integrated with Supabase storage for image uploads
   - Added drag-and-drop support for images
   - Implemented progress indicator during uploads
   - Files are stored in the 'media/course-content' bucket

3. Preview Enhancements:
   - Added mobile/desktop preview toggle
   - Implemented preview in new tab functionality
   - Enhanced content rendering with proper typography
   - Added status badges and improved layout

4. Code Cleanup:
   - Removed old course editor implementation
   - Updated routing to use new editor exclusively
   - Ensured proper integration with admin interface
   - Identified remaining old components to be removed

## Next Steps

1. Component Cleanup:
   - Remove identified old component files
   - Update documentation references
   - Verify build process succeeds
   - Test all affected routes

2. Testing:
   - Conduct thorough testing of autosave functionality
   - Test media upload features with various file types and sizes
   - Verify preview functionality across different devices
   - Ensure clean routing and navigation

3. Documentation:
   - Update user documentation with new features
   - Document media upload limitations and supported formats
   - Add usage guidelines for preview features
