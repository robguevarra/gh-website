## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive and reusable tagging system UI, including management of tag types and hierarchical tags with metadata, to support various platform features such as email segmentation and content organization.

## Current State Assessment (Start of this phase)
- No dedicated UI for managing tags or tag types existed.
- Basic Supabase tables for `tags`, `tag_types`, and `user_tags` might have been present but not fully utilized or integrated with a UI.
- Previous attempts to fetch tag types resulted in Internal Server Errors.

## Future State Goal
- A fully functional admin interface under `/admin/tag-management` with two tabs:
    - **Tag Types Tab**: Allows CRUD operations for tag types (e.g., "Email Category", "Blog Post Topic", "User Interest").
    - **Tags Tab**: Allows CRUD operations for individual tags, including:
        - Assigning a tag to a Tag Type.
        - Establishing parent-child relationships for hierarchical tagging.
        - Adding JSON metadata to tags.
- Robust error handling and type safety throughout the implementation.
- The system should be generic enough to be used for various entities (users, emails, content, etc.).

## Implementation Plan & Progress

**Phase 1: Core Functionality & UI (Completed)**

1.  **Setup State Management (`use-tag-store.ts`):**
    *   [x] Create Zustand store for managing state related to tags and tag types.
    *   [x] Implement actions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tag types.
    *   [x] Implement actions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tags.
    *   [x] Include loading and error states.

2.  **Implement Tag Types Management UI:**
    *   [x] Create `tag-type-form.tsx` for creating/editing tag types with Zod validation.
    *   [x] Create `tag-type-list.tsx` to display, add, edit, and delete tag types.
    *   [x] Integrate into `/admin/tag-management` page under a "Tag Types" tab.
    *   [x] Backend API route `/app/api/tag-types/route.ts` for CRUD operations.
    *   [x] Data access functions in `lib/supabase/data-access/tags.ts` for tag types.

3.  **Implement Tags & Hierarchy Management UI:**
    *   [x] Create `tag-form.tsx` for creating/editing individual tags (name, type, parent, metadata).
    *   [x] Create `tag-list.tsx` to display, add, edit, and delete tags, with filtering by type.
    *   [x] Integrate into `/admin/tag-management` page under a "Tags" tab.
    *   [x] Backend API route `/app/api/tags/route.ts` for CRUD operations.
    *   [x] Data access functions in `lib/supabase/data-access/tags.ts` for tags.

4.  **Bug Fixing and Refinements:**
    *   [x] Resolved "Internal Server Error" when fetching tag types by ensuring `await` on `createServerSupabaseClient()` and correct `Database` type imports in `lib/supabase/server.ts` and `lib/supabase/data-access/tags.ts`.
    *   [x] Addressed TypeScript lint error "Property 'from' does not exist..." by standardizing `Database` type import.
    *   [x] Resolved "Internal Server Error" when fetching tags by refining `parentId` handling in `/app/api/tags/route.ts` and `lib/supabase/data-access/tags.ts` to correctly interpret `null` for root tags and handle type compatibility.
    *   [x] Fixed `AlertDialogTrigger` import issue in `tag-list.tsx`.
    *   [x] Resolved `<Select.Item />` value constraint runtime error in `tag-form.tsx` by using a non-empty placeholder value for "None" options and managing conversion to/from `null`.
    *   [x] Addressed `PGRST204 "Could not find the 'metadata' column..."` error by adding the `metadata jsonb null` column to the `public.tags` table via Supabase migration.
    *   [x] Improved error logging in API routes for better diagnostics.

**Summary of Changes (Phase 1):**
A robust UI for managing tag types and hierarchical tags (with metadata) is now available at `/admin/tag-management`. The system allows for creating organizational structures for tags (types) and then creating specific tags that can be nested. Several critical bugs related to API communication, type safety, and database schema have been resolved, making the system functional. The backend API and data access layers for both tag types and tags are in place.
