# Session Management & Error Handling Implementation - Phase 1

## Task Objective
Implement robust session management and comprehensive error handling throughout the login flow as part of Task 3.5, focusing on role-based session storage, timeout mechanisms, and error handling for authentication flows.

## Current State Assessment
- Basic authentication is implemented using Supabase Auth
- Limited error handling for authentication failures
- Role information storage in session is incomplete
- No session timeout handling or refresh mechanisms
- Inconsistent error reporting across the application
- Limited security logging for authentication events

## Future State Goal
- Complete role-based session management with proper typing
- Robust error handling for all authentication scenarios
- User-friendly error messages and recovery paths
- Automatic session timeout with warning notifications
- Comprehensive security logging for authentication events
- Consistent error handling patterns across the application

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Review Existing Implementation
- [ ] Examine current session management in auth hooks
- [ ] Review how role information is currently stored
- [ ] Identify gaps in error handling for authentication flows
- [ ] Check how session timeouts are currently managed

### Step 2: Enhance Session Management
- [ ] Extend session storage to include all role information
- [ ] Create proper TypeScript interfaces for session data
- [ ] Implement session timeout mechanism with warnings
- [ ] Add session refresh functionality for active users

### Step 3: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Create an error handling utility for authentication errors
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Create error boundaries for authentication components

### Step 4: Security Logging
- [x] Implement logging for authentication attempts
- [x] Add tracking for session events (creation, updates, termination)
- [ ] Create logging for role changes within sessions
- [ ] Implement suspicious activity detection in the auth flow

### Step 5: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test all error scenarios and session management features
- [ ] Document the session management implementation
- [ ] Create developer guidelines for error handling patterns
- [ ] Update user documentation for authentication flows
