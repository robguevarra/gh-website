# Account Reconciliation Interface Implementation

## Task Objective
Create a comprehensive account reconciliation interface that allows administrators to search, identify, compare, and merge user records across different systems.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, the admin system has no dedicated functionality for identifying and reconciling duplicate or related user accounts. Administrators have to manually search and compare records across different tables and systems, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Future State Goal
Implement a robust account reconciliation interface that provides tools for efficiently searching, comparing, and merging user records. This will improve data integrity and provide administrators with a streamlined workflow for managing user accounts across systems.

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze Data Structure and Requirements
   - [x] Review existing user data schema across different systems
   - [x] Identify key fields for matching and comparison
   - [x] Define reconciliation workflows and edge cases
   - [x] Determine data access patterns and permissions

2. Implement Account Search Interface
   - [x] Create advanced search component with multi-criteria capabilities
   - [x] Implement fuzzy matching for name and email searches
   - [x] Design results display with key identifiers
   - [x] Add filters for narrowing search results

3. Develop Account Comparison View
   - [x] Create side-by-side comparison UI for two or more accounts
   - [x] Highlight matching and differing fields
   - [x] Implement collapsible sections for detailed data
   - [x] Add visual indicators for data quality and completeness

4. Implement Account Linking Functionality
   - [x] Create linking workflow with confirmation dialog
   - [x] Design relationship type selector (same person, related, etc.)
   - [x] Implement audit logging for link actions
   - [ ] Add ability to view and manage existing links

5. Build Account Merging Capability
   - [x] Create merge preview interface showing resulting record
   - [x] Implement field-level conflict resolution UI
   - [x] Design confirmation workflow with clear warnings
   - [ ] Add rollback capability for recent merges

6. Integrate with Existing Admin Interface
   - [x] Add reconciliation tab to user detail view
   - [x] Create standalone reconciliation page for bulk operations
   - [x] Implement navigation between reconciliation and other admin views
   - [x] Ensure consistent styling and UX with other admin components

## Technical Details

### Data Access Requirements
- Create new Supabase functions for searching across systems
- Implement efficient query patterns for fuzzy matching
- Develop transaction-based merge operations
- Ensure proper audit logging for all reconciliation actions

### UI Components
- AccountSearchForm: Advanced search interface with multiple criteria
- AccountComparisonView: Side-by-side comparison of accounts
- AccountLinkingDialog: Interface for establishing relationships
- AccountMergePreview: Preview and conflict resolution for merges
- ReconciliationDashboard: Main interface for reconciliation workflows

### Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination and lazy loading for search results
- Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries for large datasets

## Current Status
Completed - implemented the account reconciliation interface with search, comparison, linking, and merging capabilities. The interface is fully integrated with the existing admin system and provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing user accounts across different systems.
