# Auth Admin Access Implementation - Phase 1

## Task Objective
Implement secure admin access controls using Row Level Security (RLS) and proper authentication checks in the admin interface.

## Current State Assessment
- Inconsistent admin checks in RLS policies (mix of `role = 'admin'` and `is_admin`)
- Infinite recursion issues in profile access policies
- Cookie parsing errors in authentication flow
- Incomplete admin access checks in the admin courses page

## Future State Goal
- Standardized admin access using `is_admin` flag
- Simplified and secure RLS policies
- Proper authentication and admin status checks in admin interface
- Clear error handling and loading states

## Implementation Plan

1. Standardize RLS Policies
   - [x] Update courses table policies to use `is_admin`
   - [x] Update profiles table policies to prevent infinite recursion
   - [x] Remove duplicate policies
   - [x] Test policy changes
   - [x] Fix infinite recursion by implementing direct JWT and metadata checks
   - [x] Consolidate profile policies into a single, simplified policy

2. Update Admin Interface
   - [x] Implement proper authentication checks using `useAuth` hook
   - [x] Add admin status verification
   - [x] Add loading states for authentication and data fetching
   - [x] Implement error handling for access denied and data loading issues
   - [x] Update UI to show appropriate feedback messages

3. Cookie Handling
   - [x] Fix cookie parsing in authentication flow
   - [x] Update client implementation to use correct cookie storage adapter
   - [x] Test session persistence and token handling

4. Documentation
   - [x] Verify alignment with `authFlow.md`
   - [x] Document RLS policy changes
   - [x] Create build notes for implementation

## Notes
- RLS policies now consistently use `is_admin` for admin access
- Profile access policy simplified to prevent infinite recursion:
  - Single policy replaces multiple overlapping policies
  - Direct JWT role check for authentication
  - Direct metadata check for admin status
  - No more recursive profile checks
- Admin courses page properly handles authentication state and admin access
- Cookie handling updated to use correct storage adapter
- Implementation aligns with documented authentication flow
