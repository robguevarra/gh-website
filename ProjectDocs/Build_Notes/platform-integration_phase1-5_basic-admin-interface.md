# Basic Admin Interface - Platform Integration Phase 1.5

## Task Objective

Create a basic admin interface for the platform to manage users, courses, memberships, and platform settings while updating the authentication flow to use the new Supabase SSR package.

## Current State Assessment

The platform currently has:
- A working user dashboard with authentication
- A `/signin` page for user authentication
- The authentication system is using deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers` packages
- No admin interface for managing users and platform resources

## Future State Goal

We aim to create a functional admin interface with:
- A dashboard overview with key metrics
- User management features (listing, viewing, editing)
- Responsive design and proper navigation between admin sections
- Updated authentication flow using the new `@supabase/ssr` package

- [x] Update `app/admin/page.tsx` to use the new server client
- [x] Fix the middleware to use the new `@supabase/ssr` package

### 2. Create Admin Dashboard

- [x] Implement admin dashboard layout with sidebar and header
- [x] Create and style the admin header component
