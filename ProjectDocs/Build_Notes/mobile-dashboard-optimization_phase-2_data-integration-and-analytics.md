## Technical Notes

### Data Sources Confirmed:
- **NEW DATA**: 78 P2P transactions this month (status="paid")
- **MIGRATED DATA**: 4,825 P2P transactions (status in "success", "SUCCEEDED", "succeeded")
- **Total Enrollments**: 4,899 records in enrollments table
- **Transaction Types**: P2P, CANVA, SHOPIFY_ECOM, PUBLIC_SALE

### Key Fixes Applied:

- **Tab Separation**: Clean separation of concerns across dashboard tabs

### Current Status:
- Overview and Enrollment tabs working correctly
- Revenue tab data integration in progress
