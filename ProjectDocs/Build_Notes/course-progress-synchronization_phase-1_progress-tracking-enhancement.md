# Course Progress Synchronization Phase 1: Progress Tracking Enhancement

## Task Objective
Ensure accurate and consistent lesson completion display across the course viewer and dashboard, fixing issues where completed lessons are not properly displayed on initial load.

## Current State Assessment
- Lesson progress is not consistently displayed across components
- The CourseModuleAccordion only shows lesson completion after clicking, not on initial load
- Progress data exists in the database but is not always properly retrieved and displayed
- Data fetching logic creates potential for infinite loops and missing progress data

## Future State Goal
- Lessons show correct completion status immediately on page load
- Components maintain a single source of truth for progress data
- Robust data loading with safeguards against infinite loops
- Components that can independently verify and fetch missing progress data

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analysis and diagnosis**
   - [x] Identify root cause of lesson progress display issues
   - [x] Map the data flow between components and the database
   - [x] Investigate the component lifecycle and when data is loaded

2. **CourseModuleAccordion component enhancement**
   - [x] Enhance component to maintain local progress state
   - [x] Implement mechanism to detect and load missing progress data
   - [x] Add ref-based tracking to prevent infinite loops
   - [x] Fix type issues to ensure code quality
   - [x] Add defensive logging for easier debugging

3. **CourseProgressSection review**
   - [x] Review how CourseProgressSection receives progress data
   - [x] Check if similar enhancement pattern is needed
   - [x] Verify data consistency between components
   - [x] Implement any necessary changes for synchronization

4. **Integration testing**
   - [ ] Test initial load of course viewer
   - [ ] Verify progress persists across page navigation
   - [ ] Confirm progress updates are reflected immediately
   - [ ] Validate mobile and desktop display consistency

5. **Documentation and code comments**
   - [ ] Add explanatory comments for the progress loading mechanism
   - [ ] Document the single source of truth pattern
   - [ ] Create usage guidelines for the enhanced components
