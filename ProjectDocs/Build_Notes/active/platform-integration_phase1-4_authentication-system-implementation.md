# Authentication System Implementation (Phase 1-4)

## Task Objective
Implement a complete authentication system for the Graceful Homeschooling platform using Supabase Auth, including sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and account setup after payment flows.

## Current State Assessment
The project had a basic Supabase integration set up but lacked the necessary auth components and pages to provide a complete authentication experience. Authentication utilities were defined in the lib/supabase/auth.ts file, but no UI components or pages existed to utilize these functions.

## Future State Goal
A comprehensive authentication system with:
1. User registration (sign-up) with email verification
2. Email/password login
3. ~~Social login (Google and Facebook)~~ (Removed as per updated requirements)
4. Password reset functionality
5. Protected routes that require authentication
6. User session management
7. Responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI for all auth pages
8. Post-payment account creation flow with email-based password setup

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Authentication Components
- [x] Create SignUpForm component with form validation
- [x] Create SignInForm component with form validation
- [x] Create ResetPasswordForm component for requesting password resets
- [x] Create UpdatePasswordForm component for setting new passwords
- [x] ~~Create SocialAuth component for social media authentication~~ (Removed as per updated requirements)

### 2. Create Authentication Pages
- [x] Create Sign-up page (/auth/signup)
- [x] Create Sign-in page (/auth/signin)
- [x] Create Password reset request page (/auth/reset-password)
- [x] Create Update password page (/auth/update-password)
- [x] Create Account setup page (/auth/setup-account)
- [x] Ensure all pages are responsive and follow the design system

### 3. Configure Authentication Routes and Middleware
- [x] Verify Supabase Auth configuration in lib/supabase/auth.ts
- [x] Ensure proper auth callback handling (/auth/callback)
- [x] Implement post-payment account creation flow
- [x] Test all authentication flows

### 4. Implement Protected Routes
- [x] Create auth-protected Dashboard layout
- [x] Implement dashboard page as a test for protected routes
- [x] Add auth state detection and redirects for unauthenticated users

### 5. Test and Verify Authentication System
- [x] Test sign-up flow with email verification
- [x] Test sign-in flow
- [x] Test password reset flow
- [x] ~~Test social authentication flows~~ (Removed as per updated requirements)
- [x] Test post-payment account creation flow
- [x] Test protected routes and redirects
- [x] Verify error handling for all authentication scenarios

### 6. Documentation
- [x] Document the authentication system implementation
- [x] Create user documentation for the authentication flows
- [x] Document any known limitations or considerations

## Technical Details

### Integration with Supabase Auth
The authentication system uses the Supabase Auth service for:
- User registration and management
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Account creation after payment

### Components Structure
- Each authentication component is isolated in its own file
- Components use the shadcn/ui component library for UI elements
- All forms include proper validation and error handling

### State Management
- Authentication state is managed through the Supabase Auth client
- Protected routes check auth state and redirect unauthenticated users

### Post-Payment Account Creation Flow
- After a successful payment, we capture the user's email, name, and other details
- We create an account in Supabase with a temporary random password
- We send an email with a link for the user to set up their account password
- When the user clicks the link, they are directed to the /auth/setup-account page
- After setting their password, users are redirected to the dashboard

### Security Considerations
- Password requirements enforce minimum length and complexity
- Email verification is required to complete the signup process
- Password reset uses secure one-time tokens via email
- Protected routes are enforced both client-side and server-side
- Post-payment accounts are created with email_confirm: true to ensure users can immediately access their accounts

## Relevant Context

### Sign-up Flow
- Upon payment, we capture their name, email, number on the payment form. Then we create an account using those details. Once payment is confirmed, we send them an email with a link to access their account (which, when clicked, allows them to setup a password for their account). 

### Design Principles
- **Clarity & Elegance**: Authentication flows should be intuitive and reflect the brand's warmth and polish
- **User-Centered Design**: Prioritize user experience in authentication interfaces
- **Functional Programming**: Follow functional approach for authentication logic
- **Mobile-First**: Ensure authentication interfaces work seamlessly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: Authentication forms must be fully accessible

### Architectural Decisions
- **Authentication Provider**: Supabase Auth for core authentication functionality
- **Payment-to-Account Flow**: Users pay before account creation in certain flows
- **Email Verification**: Required for all accounts to ensure valid contact information
- **Password Options**: Traditional password login as primary authentication method
- **Role-Based Access**: Tiered access based on membership levels
- **Session Management**: Secure, HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- **Permission Enforcement**: Server-side checks using middleware and client-side UI adaptations

### Brand Requirements
- Authentication interfaces must use the Graceful Homeschooling color palette:
  - Primary (Purple): `hsl(315 15% 60%)` - #b08ba5
  - Secondary (Pink): `hsl(355 70% 85%)` - #f1b5bc
  - Accent (Blue): `hsl(200 35% 75%)` - #9ac5d9
- Typography should follow design system with Inter for form elements and Playfair Display for headings
- Animation principles should apply to transitions between authentication states

## Implementation Approach
1. First implement core authentication utilities and session management
2. Build basic sign-up and login flows with email verification
3. Implement profile management and password functionality
4. Develop role-based authorization and middleware
5. Create membership tier integration
6. Add enhancement features as needed
7. Conduct thorough testing with focus on security and edge cases

## Next Steps After Completion
Once the authentication system is implemented, we will proceed to Phase 1-5: Basic Admin Interface Implementation, which will build upon the authentication foundation to create the administrative capabilities.
