# Platform Integration - Phase 2-3: Multi-View Compatibility

## Task Objective
Implement compatibility improvements to allow simultaneous access to both admin course editor and student dashboard views, eliminating state conflicts and resource contention issues that currently prevent proper functioning when both views are accessed concurrently.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, users experience issues when attempting to access the student dashboard course view (`/dashboard/course`) while having the admin course editor (`/admin/course`) open in another tab. The student view displays only skeleton loaders and fails to load course content properly. This is caused by state management conflicts, authentication token issues, and resource contention between the two views.

## Future State Goal
A robust platform architecture that allows seamless concurrent access to both admin and student views without conflicts. Users should be able to edit courses in the admin interface while simultaneously viewing those courses in the student dashboard, with proper isolation of state and efficient resource management.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes (Phase 1-0 through Phase 2-2)
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our approach:

- **State Management**: The platform uses Zustand for global state management with appropriate persistence strategies
- **Authentication**: PKCE flow with Supabase for secure authentication with token refresh mechanisms
- **Performance**: Optimized resource loading and caching strategies to minimize API calls

### From Previously Completed Phases
The project has already completed:

- **Phase 2-1**: Course Management (implemented course editor with Zustand store)
- **Phase 2-2**: Enrollment System (implemented student dashboard with separate Zustand store)

These implementations have established patterns that should be leveraged in this phase.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Store Isolation and Naming
- [x] Rename course editor store key for better isolation
  - Updated the `name` property in the persist options from 'course-store' to 'admin-course-editor-store'
  - Ensured the new name clearly indicates its purpose (admin vs. student)
- [x] Implement proper cache isolation between views
  - Created separate cache namespaces for admin and student views
  - Added namespaced keys to prevent conflicts between different views

### 2. Cache Management Improvements
- [x] Implement automatic cache clearing when switching between views
  - Added cache clearing logic to component mount/unmount lifecycle
  - Created utility functions for targeted cache clearing in view-transition.ts
- [x] Enhance cache invalidation strategies
  - Implemented timestamp-based cache validation
  - Added namespace tracking to cached data for better isolation

### 3. Authentication Token Handling
- [x] Improve token refresh mechanism
  - Implemented a coordinated token refresh strategy across tabs using BroadcastChannel API
  - Added detection for token conflicts between tabs with timestamp tracking
- [x] Add error recovery for authentication issues
  - Implemented automatic token refresh skipping for recently refreshed tokens
  - Added better error handling in the auth context

### 4. Resource Contention Mitigation
- [x] Optimize API request patterns
  - Implemented request deduplication through cache namespacing
  - Added request coordination through auth refresh timestamps
- [x] Enhance loading state management
  - Implemented better state isolation between admin and student views
  - Added proper cleanup on component unmount

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use distinct storage keys for different feature areas
- Implement proper partitioning of persisted state
- Consider using different storage mechanisms for different types of data (sessionStorage vs. localStorage)

### Authentication
- Token refresh should be coordinated across tabs
- Consider implementing a broadcast channel for auth events
- Handle edge cases like token expiration during inactive periods

### Performance
- Minimize duplicate API calls across different views
- Implement proper request deduplication
- Use appropriate caching strategies based on data volatility

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback during loading and error states
- Implement graceful degradation when resources are unavailable
- Consider adding a manual refresh option for stale data

## Completion Status

This phase has been completed successfully. The following has been accomplished:

- Identified root causes of multi-view compatibility issues
- Developed comprehensive solution strategy
- Implemented all planned improvements

Challenges addressed:
- Browser storage limitations and conflicts - Resolved with namespaced storage keys
- Authentication token refresh coordination - Implemented with BroadcastChannel API
- Resource contention between concurrent views - Mitigated with better cache management

Implemented solutions:
1. ✅ Renamed course editor store key to 'admin-course-editor-store'
2. ✅ Implemented proper cache isolation with namespaces
3. ✅ Added automatic cache clearing with view transition utilities
4. ✅ Improved token refresh mechanism with cross-tab coordination
5. ✅ Optimized API request patterns with deduplication

## Next Steps After Completion

After establishing multi-view compatibility, we will move on to Phase 2-4: Performance Optimization, focusing on further improving the platform's performance, especially for users with limited bandwidth or older devices.
