# Password Reset Flow Enhancement (Phase 1)

## Task Objective
Enhance the password reset flow to handle all edge cases, including proper feedback when tokens have expired or have already been used.

## Current State Assessment
The password reset flow was functional but lacked proper feedback for specific error cases. When users tried to use a password reset link that had already been used, the system would show a generic error rather than a clear explanation and path forward.

## Future State Goal
A robust password reset flow that:
1. Provides clear, specific feedback for all token states (valid, expired, used, invalid)
2. Offers a direct path to request a new password reset link when needed
3. Includes visual feedback with animations throughout the process
4. Confirms successful password changes with a success message on the sign-in page

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Token Validation and Status Handling
- [x] Create a token status state in the update-password page
- [x] Implement token verification with specific error message detection
- [x] Handle expired tokens with appropriate messaging
- [x] Handle already-used tokens with clear feedback
- [x] Handle invalid tokens with helpful guidance

### 2. User Interface Enhancements
- [x] Add conditional rendering based on token status
- [x] Show appropriate alerts with descriptive error messages
- [x] Provide a direct link to request a new password reset when needed
- [x] Add animations for form interactions and state transitions
- [x] Implement loading and success animations

### 3. Process Flow Improvements
- [x] Ensure proper redirection after successful password update
- [x] Add success message on sign-in page after password update
- [x] Improve token handling in auth callback
- [x] Update the password form to handle both session and token-based updates

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [x] Handle session missing scenarios properly
- [x] Provide fallback options for all error states
- [x] Test different token scenarios (valid, expired, used, invalid)
- [x] Ensure UI remains responsive during all states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Token Status Management
- Added a tokenStatus state with possible values: 'valid', 'invalid', 'expired', 'used', 'loading', or null
- Implemented token verification in useEffect that checks for specific error messages
- Created conditional rendering based on token status

### Error Message Improvements
- Added specific error messages for each failure case:
  - "This password reset link has expired. Please request a new one."
  - "This password reset link has already been used. If you need to reset your password again, please request a new link."
  - "Invalid password reset link. Please request a new one."

### User Experience Enhancements
- Added loading animations during password update
- Implemented success animations after successful update
- Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added clear visual feedback for form validation errors
- Added a success message on sign-in page after password update

### Authentication Flow Integration
- Enhanced the auth callback route to properly handle token parameters
- Updated the UpdatePasswordForm to work with both session-based and token-based updates
- Improved error handling in form submission

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding additional security measures such as rate limiting for password reset requests
- Explore possibilities for passwordless authentication options
- Add analytics to monitor password reset success rates

## Completion Criteria
- ✅ Users receive clear, specific feedback when using an expired or used token
- ✅ System provides a direct path to request a new password reset link
- ✅ Successful password updates are confirmed with a success message
- ✅ Animation provides visual feedback throughout the process
- ✅ All edge cases are handled with appropriate messaging
