# User Support Diagnostic Tool - Phase 1: Investigation and Planning

## Task Objective
Build a comprehensive admin diagnostic tool to resolve common user support issues related to email conflicts, missing welcome emails, and Shopify purchase attribution in our fragmented-to-unified system migration.

## Current State Assessment
- **Fragmented Legacy System**: Users have purchases across multiple platforms (Shopify, direct transactions) with different emails
- **Unified New System**: Internal shop for registered users only, but missing attribution for legacy purchases
- **User Pain Points**: Tech-challenged moms often use wrong emails, can't find their purchases, or miss welcome emails
- **Admin Pain Points**: No quick diagnostic tool to resolve user issues efficiently
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Xendit webhooks, Postmark emails, partial dashboard button that calls non-existent API
- **Current Shopify Attribution**: Already working via `shopify_customers.unified_profile_id` field - just need to fill gaps

## Future State Goal
- **Comprehensive Admin Diagnostic Tool**: Search users by any email, view all associated data, identify attribution gaps
- **Email Management System**: Update primary emails, add secondary emails, link orphaned purchases
- **Automated Welcome Email Resend**: Based on transaction history and payment type
- **Simplified Attribution Workflow**: Use existing `shopify_customers.unified_profile_id` system, not create new tables
- **Minimal Audit Trail**: Track only essential changes for security

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### Database Changes Required:
```sql
-- unified_profiles table addition
ALTER TABLE unified_profiles ADD COLUMN secondary_emails JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Simple audit fields for shopify_customers (use existing table)
ALTER TABLE shopify_customers ADD COLUMN manual_link_notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE shopify_customers ADD COLUMN linked_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE shopify_customers ADD COLUMN linked_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Optional: Email change log (only if needed for compliance)
CREATE TABLE email_change_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  old_email TEXT,
  new_email TEXT,
  changed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  change_type TEXT, -- 'primary_update', 'secondary_add', 'secondary_remove'
  verification_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);

-- Indexes for efficient searching
CREATE INDEX idx_unified_profiles_secondary_emails ON unified_profiles USING gin (secondary_emails);
CREATE INDEX idx_shopify_customers_email ON shopify_customers(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_shopify_orders_email ON shopify_orders(email);
```

### API Endpoints Structure:
```
POST /api/admin/user-diagnostic
- Body: { email: string }
- Returns: Complete user data across all tables

POST /api/admin/email-management/update-primary
- Body: { userId, newEmail, verification }
- Updates: Cascades across all tables

POST /api/admin/email-management/add-secondary
- Body: { userId, secondaryEmail }
- Updates: unified_profiles.secondary_emails

POST /api/admin/email-management/link-shopify-customer
- Body: { unifiedProfileId, shopifyCustomerId, notes }
- Updates: shopify_customers.unified_profile_id

POST /api/admin/email-management/resend-welcome
- Body: { userId, transactionType }
- Sends: Context-aware welcome email
```

### Security Considerations:
- Admin-only endpoints with proper authentication
- Email verification required for primary email changes
- Simple audit trail using existing table fields
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Manual verification workflow for high-value attributions

## User Scenarios to Solve:

### Scenario 1: Wrong Email Registration
```
User: "I registered with sarahtypo@gmail.com but meant sarah@gmail.com"
Solution: 
1. Admin searches for user by current email
2. Verifies new email with user
3. Updates primary email (cascades to all tables)
4. Sends confirmation to both emails
```

### Scenario 2: Missing Welcome Email
```
User: "I paid but never got my welcome email"
Solution:
1. Admin searches by email
2. Views transaction history
3. Identifies payment type (P2P, Canva, Shopify)
4. Resends appropriate welcome email via Postmark
```

### Scenario 3: Shopify Purchase Attribution
```
User: "I bought from old Shopify with different.email@yahoo.com"
Solution:
1. Admin searches current user by registration email
2. Searches Shopify customers/orders by claimed email
3. Verifies purchase details with user
4. Updates shopify_customers.unified_profile_id to link accounts
5. User's purchase history now shows Shopify orders
```

## Existing System Utilization:
- **Current Attribution Path**: `shopify_orders → shopify_customers → unified_profiles`
- **Link Field**: `shopify_customers.unified_profile_id` (already exists)
- **Email Matching Script**: `scripts/link-shopify-customers.ts` (already working)
- **Missing Links**: Some shopify_customers have NULL unified_profile_id
- **Solution**: Fill gaps in existing system, don't create duplicate tables

## Risk Mitigation:
- **Fraud Prevention**: Manual verification for all Shopify attributions
- **Data Integrity**: Use existing database relationships
- **User Experience**: Clear communication during email changes
- **System Security**: Admin-only access with proper authentication
- **Simplicity**: Work with existing system rather than over-engineering

## Success Metrics:
- Reduced user support tickets related to email/purchase issues
- Faster resolution times for common user problems
- Improved user satisfaction with support experience
- Complete attribution of legacy Shopify purchases via existing unified_profile_id field
- Zero unauthorized access incidents

## Dependencies:
- Supabase database access for schema changes
- Postmark email service for welcome email resends
- Admin authentication system
- Existing unified_profiles and shopify_orders data
- Current shopify_customers.unified_profile_id attribution system

## Timeline Estimate:
- **Phase 1 (Database & API)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2 (Admin UI)**: 2-3 days  
- **Phase 3 (Integration & Testing)**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 5-8 days
