# Data Unification - Phase 3-2: Migration Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement the data migration process to populate the enhanced database schema with unified data from the existing Xendit and Systemeio tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the migration.

## Current State Assessment
We have designed a unified database schema in Phase 3-1 with properly structured tables for profiles, transactions, and enrollments. However, the actual data still resides in the original Xendit and Systemeio tables in their raw format. We need a robust migration process to transform and load this data into our new schema.

## Future State Goal
A successfully completed data migration with:
1. All relevant historical data preserved and properly transformed
2. Unified user profiles that combine information from both sources
3. Normalized transaction records linked to appropriate profiles
4. Course enrollments derived from payment transactions
5. Data validation to ensure consistency and integrity
6. Documentation of any data quality issues encountered

This migration will populate our new schema with clean, consistent data that is ready for use in dashboard analytics and business intelligence features.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Data Unification Strategy (Phase 3-0)
> 2. Database Schema Enhancement (Phase 3-1)
> 3. Project Context (`ProjectContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Data Unification Strategy
The strategy established:
- Email as the primary matching key between systems
- Data transformation rules for standardizing formats
- Conflict resolution approach (Xendit authoritative for payments, Systemeio for profiles)

### From Database Schema Enhancement
The schema includes:
- Unified profiles table with user information
- Normalized transactions table for payment data
- Enrollments table connecting users to courses

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Prepare Migration Environment
- [ ] Create database snapshots for rollback capability
  - Backup existing Xendit and Systemeio tables
  - Document table schemas and row counts
- [ ] Set up migration logging infrastructure
  - Create migration_log table to track progress
  - Implement detailed error logging
  - Set up migration state tracking
- [ ] Establish test environment for migration validation
  - Create a staging schema for migration testing
  - Set up data validation queries
  - Prepare comparison reports for before/after validation

### 2. Implement Profile Data Migration
- [ ] Create `migrate_profiles` function that:
  - Extracts unique emails from both Xendit and Systemeio
  - Combines profile information using defined precedence rules
  - Handles normalization of name fields
  - Links to auth.users where possible
  - Logs conflicts and resolution decisions
- [ ] Develop email matching algorithm
  - Implement case-insensitive matching
  - Handle common variations and typos
  - Detect and flag potential duplicates
- [ ] Create validation queries for profiles
  - Verify no data was lost during migration
  - Check for required fields completeness
  - Validate format standardization

### 3. Implement Transaction Data Migration
- [ ] Create `migrate_transactions` function that:
  - Transforms Xendit payment records to normalized format
  - Links transactions to unified profiles by email
  - Standardizes status values and amount formats
  - Properly converts timestamp fields with timezone handling
  - Categorizes transactions by product type
- [ ] Implement payment categorization logic
  - Identify "Papers to Profits Learning Fee" transactions
  - Identify "Canva Ebook" transactions
  - Map to standardized product identifiers
- [ ] Create validation queries for transactions
  - Verify all payments were migrated
  - Check for correct profile associations
  - Validate status mappings

### 4. Implement Enrollment Generation
- [ ] Create `generate_enrollments` function that:
  - Analyzes successful payment transactions
  - Creates enrollment records for course purchases
  - Sets appropriate enrollment status and dates
  - Links to both user profiles and courses
  - Handles access expiration calculations
- [ ] Implement course mapping logic
  - Map "Papers to Profits Learning Fee" to appropriate course
  - Map "Canva Ebook" to appropriate product
  - Handle potential custom or special enrollments
- [ ] Create validation queries for enrollments
  - Verify enrollments match payment records
  - Check for correct course associations
  - Validate enrollment status consistency

### 5. Implement Incremental Synchronization
- [ ] Create `sync_new_data` function that:
  - Identifies new records since last migration
  - Applies same transformation and loading logic
  - Updates existing records where appropriate
  - Maintains data consistency across tables
- [ ] Develop change detection mechanisms
  - Track last processed record IDs
  - Implement timestamp-based detection
  - Handle deleted or modified records
- [ ] Create automated testing for sync process
  - Verify incremental sync produces same results as full migration
  - Test boundary conditions and edge cases
  - Validate performance under different data volumes

### 6. Data Quality Remediation
- [ ] Implement data cleaning processes
  - Standardize inconsistent name formatting
  - Fix obvious data entry errors
  - Handle missing required fields
- [ ] Create exception reports for manual review
  - Identify records with unresolvable conflicts
  - Flag potentially incorrect email matches
  - Highlight unusual patterns for verification
- [ ] Document data quality issues
  - Create inventory of known data problems
  - Suggest preventive measures for future data collection
  - Provide recommendations for data governance

### 7. Migration Execution and Verification
- [ ] Develop migration execution plan
  - Step-by-step process with checkpoints
  - Estimated timing for each phase
  - Rollback procedures for each step
- [ ] Create comprehensive validation script
  - Data completeness checks
  - Referential integrity validation
  - Business rule verification
- [ ] Prepare migration outcome report
  - Statistics on migrated data
  - Identified issues and resolutions
  - Recommendations for future improvements

## Technical Considerations

### Migration Performance
1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process data in manageable chunks (1000-5000 records)
   - Implement progress tracking for long-running migrations
   - Consider resource utilization during peak hours

2. **Transaction Safety**:
   - Wrap migration operations in transactions for atomicity
   - Implement checkpoints for safe resume capability
   - Consider read-only access during migration

### Data Quality Assurance
1. **Validation Approach**:
   - Implement both automated and manual validation
   - Create data quality scorecards for key metrics
   - Develop visual reports for before/after comparison

2. **Exception Handling**:
   - Create clear process for handling data exceptions
   - Implement fallback values for non-critical fields
   - Document all exception cases for future reference

### Incremental Updates
1. **Change Detection**:
   - Implement reliable change tracking mechanism
   - Handle potential race conditions during updates
   - Consider eventual consistency requirements

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Document conflict resolution rules for incremental updates
   - Implement version tracking for changed records
   - Create alerts for unresolvable conflicts

## Completion Status

This phase is currently in progress. Tasks completed:
- Migration environment preparation
- Initial profile matching algorithm implementation

Challenges identified:
- Handling inconsistent email formats across systems
- Resolving timestamp timezone discrepancies
- Ensuring all business rules are correctly applied during migration

## Next Steps After Completion
After implementing the data migration, we will move to Phase 3-3: Dashboard Core Architecture, where we will begin building the admin dashboard foundation based on our unified data model.
