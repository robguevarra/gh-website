# Affiliate Dashboard UI - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Develop a comprehensive, responsive, and user-friendly affiliate dashboard interface that provides affiliates with tools to track performance, generate referral links, and monitor payouts for the Graceful Homeschooling single-product affiliate program.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing UI and Components
- Basic placeholder affiliate dashboard UI exists at `/app/affiliate-portal/page.tsx` with sections for stats, referral links, and payouts
- The current page uses static mock data for affiliate metrics:
  ```tsx
  const affiliateData = {
    slug: 'your-unique-slug',
    clicks: 1250,
    conversions: 75,
    earnings: 1875.50,
    conversionRate: (75 / 1250) * 100,
    nextPayoutDate: '15/07/2024',
    minPayout: 100,
  };
  ```
- `AffiliateHeader` component exists in `components/affiliate/affiliate-header.tsx` and contains:
  - User display name and avatar
  - Dropdown menu for account settings, earnings, profile, and logout
  - Integration with `DashboardSwitcher` for multi-role navigation
- `GlobalAffiliateTracker` component in `components/affiliate/global-affiliate-tracker.tsx` tracks affiliate clicks by:
  - Reading affiliate slug (`a` parameter) from URL
  - Capturing UTM parameters for analytics
  - Sending tracking request to backend API
  - Setting tracking cookies for affiliate and visitor IDs

### Authentication and Route Protection
- Authentication context (`auth-context.tsx`) is fully implemented with Supabase
- Middleware (`middleware.ts`) already includes:
  - Route protection for `/affiliate-portal/*` routes 
  - Role-based access control via `unified_profiles` table
  - Session refresh and security headers
  - Cookie management for authentication

### Database Schema and Structure
- Supabase Project ID: `cidenjydokpzpsnpywcf` (required for API interactions)
- Custom Enum Types:
  - Affiliate statuses: `pending`, `active`, `flagged`, `inactive`
  - Conversion statuses: `pending`, `cleared`, `paid`, `flagged`
- Key Tables and Relationships:
  - `unified_profiles`: Central user table with `affiliate_id` (FK) and `affiliate_general_status` fields
  - `affiliates`: Core affiliate data with `user_id` (FK), `slug`, `commission_rate`, `is_member`, and `status`
  - `affiliate_clicks`: Tracks click events with `affiliate_id` (FK), `visitor_id`, `ip_address`, etc.
  - `affiliate_conversions`: Records successful conversions with `affiliate_id` (FK), `click_id` (FK), `commission_amount`, etc.
  - `fraud_flags`: Logs suspicious activity with `affiliate_id` (FK) and resolution status
  - `membership_levels`: Defines different tiers with `commission_rate` values

### API Endpoints and Services
- Click tracking API implemented in `/api/affiliate/click/route.ts`:
  - Validates affiliate slug
  - Records click data
  - Sets tracking cookies
- Service modules:
  - `tracking-service.ts`: Handles visitor ID generation, IP extraction, user-agent parsing
  - `conversion-service.ts`: Provides functions for recording conversions and creating network postbacks
  - `conversion-status.ts`: Manages status updates and tracks status history in JSONB

## Future State Goal
A fully functional affiliate dashboard that:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Leverages existing route protection via middleware.ts
   - Enforces affiliate role verification with proper status checking (`active` required)
   - Integrates with Supabase Auth and the unified_profiles/affiliates tables

2. **Dashboard Analytics**
   - Displays real-time performance metrics (clicks, conversions, earnings, conversion rate)
   - Provides time-series charts for trend analysis (daily, weekly, monthly views)
   - Shows geographic distribution of traffic with interactive heat maps
   - Visualizes conversion funnel from clicks to completed transactions
   - Tracks earnings over time with commission breakdown

3. **Referral Link Management**
   - Generates personalized referral links using the affiliate's unique slug
   - Creates customizable UTM parameters for campaign tracking
   - Produces high-quality QR codes for offline/print promotion
   - Supports one-click copy to clipboard with visual confirmation
   - Enables direct social sharing to major platforms
   - Provides link performance analytics per generated link

4. **Payout Dashboard**
   - Shows complete payout history with status indicators (pending, cleared, paid, flagged)
   - Displays estimated future payouts based on pending conversions
   - Provides minimum payout threshold information and progress indicators
   - Includes detailed transaction-level reporting for transparency
   - Implements status history tracking for each transaction

5. **Technical Requirements**
   - Achieves responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
   - Maintains performance benchmark of p95 â‰¤ 1s on 3G connections
   - Implements proper loading states and error handling
