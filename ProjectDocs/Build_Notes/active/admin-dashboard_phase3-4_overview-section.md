# Admin Dashboard - Phase 3-4: Overview Section

## Status Update (2024-06-10)
**This phase is now ACTIVE.**

The Overview section is unpaused because the unified data migration is complete and real data is now available in the unified tables. The dashboard can now display accurate metrics, trends, and activity feeds based on production data.

**Rationale:**
- The unified tables are populated:
  - `unified_profiles`: 2,746 rows
  - `transactions`: 2,888 rows
  - `enrollments`: 2,450 rows
- The migration process (see `@data-unification_phase3-2_migration-implementation.md`) is complete and validated.
- The backend API and frontend components for the Overview section are ready to consume real data.
- We can now proceed with implementing and validating the dashboard's business intelligence features.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement date slicers (date range filters) for metrics and trends.
2. Connect the dashboard to production data and validate all metrics and trends with real data.
3. Perform full QA and polish UI/UX as needed.
4. Update build notes and documentation as further changes are made.
5. **[2024-06-10]** Continue with frontend adjustments to further improve the recent activity display and user experience.
6. **[2024-06-10]** Ensure all future financial metrics and displays use PHP/₱ for consistency.

## Task Objective
Implement the Overview section of the admin dashboard, providing at-a-glance business intelligence with key metrics, trend visualizations, and summary insights for enrollment and revenue performance. This phase transitions the dashboard from mock/demo data to real, actionable analytics powered by the unified data model and analytics views.

## Current State Assessment (Update: 2024-06-10)
- The backend API endpoint `/api/admin/dashboard/overview` is implemented and aggregates real business intelligence metrics using the unified tables and analytics views.
- The frontend `DashboardOverview` component is refactored to fetch from the new API endpoint and display real summary metrics, trends, and recent activity.
- **Chart integration is complete:** Enrollment and Revenue Trends now use real, responsive charts (Recharts) with modular components.
- All code is modular, well-commented, and follows industry best practices.
- The UI is ready for real data, but may show empty or zero values if the database is not yet populated with production data.
- Trend charts are now real charts, but **date slicers (date range filters) are not yet implemented**.
- **[2024-06-10] Recent Payments API Fix:**
  - **Root Cause:** Supabase join syntax (`!user_id`) for recent payments acted as an inner join, omitting payments with missing user profiles.
  - **Solution:** Refactored the API to fetch recent payments first, then fetch all relevant user profiles in a second query, and merge the data in code. This ensures all payments are shown, with names where available and user ID as fallback.
  - **Result:** Recent payments now display correctly, matching previous behavior but with improved name display where possible.
- **[2024-06-10] Currency Localization:**
  - All currency formatting and icons in the dashboard overview are now set to Philippine Peso (₱/PHP) for local relevance.
  - The `formatCurrency` function uses `currency: 'PHP'`.
  - The revenue metric and recent payments tab now display a bold peso sign (₱) instead of the dollar sign.
- **[2024-06-11] Monthly Trend Aggregation Fix:**
  - **Root Cause:** Fetching monthly enrollment and revenue trends for long date ranges (e.g., 1 year) resulted in inaccurate data. The API fetched all individual records, hit Supabase's default 1000-row limit, and performed incomplete aggregation in the API code.
  - **Solution:** Implemented database-side aggregation using Supabase RPC. Created two PostgreSQL functions (`get_monthly_enrollment_trends`, `get_monthly_revenue_trends`) that calculate monthly totals directly in the database.
  - **API Update:** The `/api/admin/dashboard/overview` route now calls these RPC functions when the `granularity` is 'month'. This avoids the row limit and delegates aggregation to the database.
  - **Result:** Monthly trends are now accurate, faster to load, and more scalable, regardless of the date range or number of underlying records.

## Future State Goal
A fully implemented Overview dashboard section with:
1. Top-level KPI metrics showing enrollment totals, revenue, conversion rates, and active users, all calculated from real, unified data
2. Time-series trend visualizations for enrollments and revenue, using analytics views and supporting date range filtering
3. Recent activity feed highlighting important events (enrollments, payments, system events)
4. Performance summaries comparing current metrics to previous periods, with percentage change indicators
5. Responsive, accessible, and branded UI leveraging reusable components and following design system guidelines
6. Efficient, cacheable API endpoints serving all required data for the Overview section

## Implementation Plan (Status: 2024-06-09)
- [x] Backend: Implement real API endpoint for overview metrics and trends
- [x] Frontend: Refactor Overview section to consume and display real data
- [x] Integrate a real charting library (Recharts) for trend visualizations
- [x] Build and test all new UI and utility components
- [x] Document all changes and update build notes at each step
- [ ] **Implement date slicers (date range filters) for metrics and trends**
- [ ] Connect to production data and validate with real business metrics (pending data migration/production rollout)

## Charting & Visualization
- Enrollment and Revenue Trends now use modular, responsive Recharts components.
- Charts are accessible, styled, and ready for real data.
- Tooltips, axis labels, and responsive containers are included.
- **Date slicers are not yet implemented**; all metrics and trends currently use default (e.g., last 12 months, current/previous month) periods.

## Testing & Validation

### How to Test the Overview Section
1. **Local Development/Test Environment:**
   - Start your Next.js development server.
   - Navigate to the admin dashboard Overview section.
   - The dashboard should fetch data from `/api/admin/dashboard/overview` and display summary metrics, trends, and recent activity.
   - If the database is empty or not yet connected to real data, you may see zeros, empty charts, or empty activity feeds. This is expected until real data is available.
   - The UI should remain responsive and show appropriate empty states (e.g., "No data", "No recent enrollments").

2. **With Mock or Seed Data:**
   - Populate the unified tables (`enrollments`, `transactions`, etc.) with test data using Supabase Studio or SQL scripts.
   - Refresh the dashboard and verify that metrics, trends, and activity feeds update accordingly.
   - Check that percent changes and period-over-period comparisons are calculated and displayed.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Temporarily break the API or disconnect the database to verify that error toasts and fallback UI are shown.

4. **Accessibility & Responsiveness:**
   - Test the dashboard on different screen sizes and with keyboard navigation.
   - Ensure all metric cards, charts, and activity feeds are accessible and readable.

### What to Expect If Not Connected to Real Data
- All metrics will show zero or empty values.
- Trend charts will display "No data".
- Recent activity feeds will show empty states.
- This is normal and expected until the data migration and onboarding phases are complete.

## What Is Left To Do
- **Implement date slicers (date range filters):**
  - Add UI controls to select custom date ranges for metrics and trend charts.
  - Update API and frontend to support dynamic date filtering.
  - Ensure all metrics, trends, and activity feeds update based on selected date range.
- Connect the dashboard to production data after the data migration and onboarding phases are complete.
- Perform full QA with real business data and validate all metrics.
- Polish UI/UX and add additional insights or drill-downs as needed.

## Alignment with Previous Phases & Build Notes
