# Admin Console Extension - Phase 1: Affiliate Management

## Task Objective
Extend the existing admin console with comprehensive affiliate management capabilities, including affiliate approval workflows, performance monitoring, fraud detection, and program settings management.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Admin Console Structure
- Admin console is implemented at `/app/admin/` with a sidebar navigation (`components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx`)
- Current navigation includes: Dashboard, Users, Courses, Membership Tiers, Reports, Email Campaigns, Shop Integration, Security, and Settings
- Admin layout (`app/admin/layout.tsx`) handles authentication, admin validation, and page structure
- Route protection is implemented via middleware and `validateAdminStatus` function

### Affiliate System Implementation
- Affiliate database schema is complete with tables for:
  - `affiliates`: Core affiliate data with status and commission rates
  - `affiliate_clicks`: Click tracking
  - `affiliate_conversions`: Conversion and commission tracking
  - `fraud_flags`: Fraud detection and management
- Affiliate dashboard UI (/affiliate-portal) is fully implemented with:
  - Performance metrics and visual analytics
  - Referral link generation and management
  - Payout tracking and request capabilities
  - Mobile-responsive design and proper layout

### Missing Components
- No dedicated admin interface exists for affiliate management
- Affiliate approval workflow is not implemented
- No fraud review system in place
- No program-wide affiliate analytics for administrators
- No configuration interface for affiliate program settings

## Future State Goal
Create a comprehensive, secure, and intuitive admin interface for managing all aspects of the affiliate program, including:

1. A central affiliate management dashboard with key metrics
2. Tools for reviewing and approving/rejecting affiliate applications
3. A fraud detection and review system
4. Program-wide analytics with filtering and export capabilities
5. Configuration interface for program settings
6. Audit logging for all admin actions
