# Course Editor Enhancement Phase 2: Intuitive Course Creation

## Task Objective
Create a stable, user-friendly course editor that enables course creators to efficiently manage and create course content.

## Current State Assessment
### Working Features
- Basic course editor with module/lesson management
- TipTap rich text editor integration
- Drag-and-drop functionality with @hello-pangea/dnd
- Collapsible module tree with folder icons
- Module and lesson API routes updated for Next.js 15 dynamic params

### Current Issues
- Save functionality not working reliably
  - Root cause: Mismatch between client-side state and API expectations
  - Related to Supabase Auth Helpers deprecation and SSR migration
- Student preview mode broken
  - Needs update to handle Next.js 15 dynamic routing
- State management needs optimization
  - Multiple sources of truth causing conflicts
  - Unnecessary re-renders and data fetching

## Critical Context Updates

### Next.js 15 Dynamic API Changes
- Dynamic route parameters are now Promises
- Cookie handling requires proper async/await
- Static and dynamic routes have different client creation methods

### Supabase Migration Requirements
- @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs is deprecated
- Must migrate to @supabase/ssr
- Need to update client creation methods
- Cookie handling needs to be updated

## Future State Goal
A stable, efficient course editor that:
- Maintains state without unexpected reloads
- Provides reliable content creation and editing
- Offers seamless module and lesson management
- Ensures consistent save functionality
- Delivers a smooth preview experience
- Fully compliant with Next.js 15 and latest Supabase practices

  - [x] Implement proper state hydration
  - [ ] Add state validation
  - [ ] Optimize state updates
- [x] Error Prevention
  - [x] Add error boundaries
  - [x] Implement state recovery
  - [x] Add error logging

## Technical Dependencies
- Next.js 15+
- @supabase/ssr (replacing auth-helpers)
- TipTap
- @hello-pangea/dnd
- Zustand
- Shadcn UI

## Fix Implementation Strategy

1. **Save Functionality Fix**
   - Root cause: Mismatch between client state and API expectations
   - Solution steps:
     1. Migrate to @supabase/ssr
     2. Update client creation in route handlers
     3. Fix cookie handling for dynamic routes
     4. Update state management to match API schema

2. **Student Preview Fix**
   - Root cause: Incompatibility with Next.js 15 dynamic routing
   - Solution steps:
     1. Update preview route to handle dynamic params
     2. Fix state management in preview mode
     3. Implement proper SSR handling
     4. Update client-side navigation

## Success Criteria
1. Save functionality works reliably with proper error handling
2. Preview mode renders correctly and maintains state
3. No unexpected page reloads
4. All API routes handle dynamic params correctly
5. State management follows single source of truth

## Current Status

Recent fixes:
- Updated module API routes for Next.js 15
- Fixed random page reloads
- Improved error handling
- Added proper cookie handling

Remaining challenges:
- Save functionality needs migration to @supabase/ssr
- Student preview mode broken
- State management optimization needed

## Next Steps
1. Migrate to @supabase/ssr
2. Update save functionality
3. Fix student preview mode
4. Optimize state management
5. Implement comprehensive testing
