# Course Editor Enhancement Phase 2: Intuitive Course Creation

## Task Objective
Create a stable, user-friendly course editor that enables course creators to efficiently manage and create course content.

## Current State Assessment
### Working Features
- Basic course editor with module/lesson management
- TipTap rich text editor integration
- Drag-and-drop functionality with @hello-pangea/dnd
- Collapsible module tree with folder icons
- Module and lesson API routes updated for Next.js 15 dynamic params
- Reliable save functionality with visual feedback
- Autosave with debounce
- Cursor position preservation during saves
- Content state synchronization
- Consolidated PATCH requests for better performance
- Next.js 15 dynamic route parameter handling

### Current Issues
- Student preview mode broken
  - Needs update to handle Next.js 15 dynamic routing
- State management needs optimization
  - Multiple sources of truth causing conflicts
  - Unnecessary re-renders and data fetching
- Technical Debt
  - Punycode module deprecation warning needs to be addressed
  - Consider using a userland alternative for URL encoding/decoding

## Critical Context Updates

### Next.js 15 Dynamic API Changes
- Dynamic route parameters are now Promises
- Cookie handling requires proper async/await
- Static and dynamic routes have different client creation methods
- All route handlers updated to properly await dynamic params

### Supabase Migration Requirements
- @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs is deprecated
- Must migrate to @supabase/ssr
- Need to update client creation methods
- Cookie handling needs to be updated

## Future State Goal
A stable, efficient course editor that:
- Maintains state without unexpected reloads
