## Course Settings Panel Implementation

### Overview
The course settings panel has been completely revamped to connect with the actual course data in the database. Previously, the panel was using hardcoded values and simulated save operations, which meant that course settings weren't being persisted properly.

### Key Improvements

1. **Data Connection**
   - Connected settings panel to the course store using `useCourseStore` hook
   - Implemented proper data binding for all form fields
   - Added TypeScript type definitions for course metadata

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Used React's `useEffect` to update form state when course data changes
   - Implemented proper TypeScript typing for metadata fields
   - Added error handling for API calls
   - Used proper state management patterns

### Metadata Structure
Course settings are stored in the `metadata` field of the course object, which is a JSON field in the database. The metadata structure includes:

```typescript
type CourseMetadata = {
  code?: string;
  category?: string;
  level?: string;
  featured?: boolean;
  access?: string;
  prerequisites?: string;
  requirements?: {
    completeAll?: boolean;
    passQuizzes?: boolean;
    submitAssignments?: boolean;
  };
  enableCertificate?: boolean;
  discussion?: string;
  progress?: string;
  analytics?: boolean;
  publishDate?: string;
};
```

This structure allows for flexible extension of course settings without requiring database schema changes.
