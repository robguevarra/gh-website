# Platform Integration - Phase 2-1: Course Management

## Task Objective
Implement comprehensive course management capabilities for the Graceful Homeschooling platform, enabling administrators to create, edit, publish, and manage courses and their content.

## Current State Assessment
The platform currently has basic database schema for courses but lacks user interfaces and functionality for course creation, content management, and publishing workflows. Administrators need a way to manage course content through the admin interface.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional course management system with intuitive interfaces for administrators to create courses, organize content into modules and lessons, upload media, and control publishing status. Course content should be structured consistently and accessed efficiently by the user-facing course delivery system.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes (Phase 1-0 through Phase 1-6)
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our course management approach:
- **Course Structure**: Hierarchical organization with courses, modules, and lessons
- **Content Types**: Support for text, images, video, and interactive elements
- **User Roles**: Different access levels for course creation and management
- **Publishing Workflow**: Draft, review, and published states for course content

### From Design Context
From the `designContext.md`, the following design principles apply:
- **Admin Interfaces**: Clean, structured layouts with clear hierarchies
- **Form Design**: Consistent validation patterns and error states
- **Content Editing**: WYSIWYG interfaces for content creation
- **Media Management**: Intuitive uploading and embedding of images and videos

### From Previously Completed Phases
The project has already completed:
- **Phase 1-3**: Database Schema Implementation (including course-related tables)
- **Phase 1-6**: Project Structure (establishing coding patterns and documentation standards)

These implementations have established patterns that should be leveraged in this phase.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Course Creation Interface
- [ ] Design and implement course creation form
  - Create form for basic course information (title, description, etc.)
  - Implement thumbnail image upload and management
  - Add pricing and availability controls
- [ ] Develop course metadata management
  - Create tagging system for courses
  - Implement category selection
  - Add prerequisite selection interface

### 2. Module and Lesson Management
- [ ] Implement module management interfaces
  - Create module creation and editing interface
  - Develop module ordering capabilities
  - Add module visibility controls
- [ ] Build lesson creation system
  - Implement lesson type selection
  - Create content editing interface
  - Add media embedding capabilities

### 3. Content Editing Tools
- [ ] Implement rich text editor for lesson content
  - Integrate WYSIWYG editor with formatting options
  - Add media insertion capabilities
  - Implement content validation
- [ ] Create media management system
  - Build media library interface
  - Implement media upload functionality
  - Create media organization capabilities

### 4. Publishing Workflow
- [ ] Implement content status management
  - Create draft/published states for all content
  - Implement status change workflow
  - Add validation before publishing
- [ ] Develop preview capabilities
  - Create course preview functionality
  - Implement module and lesson previews
  - Add device-specific preview options

### 5. Course Organization and Navigation
- [ ] Build course organization tools
  - Implement drag-and-drop reordering for modules and lessons
  - Create sorting and filtering options
  - Add search capabilities for course content
- [ ] Develop navigation controls
  - Implement breadcrumb navigation
  - Create quick navigation between related content
  - Add navigation history

## Technical Considerations

### Database Interactions
- Use optimistic updates for quick UI feedback
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations
- Cache course data appropriately to minimize database calls

### User Experience
- Implement autosave functionality for content editing
- Use drag-and-drop interfaces for content ordering
- Provide clear feedback on publishing status

### Performance
- Lazy load content in admin interfaces to improve load times
- Optimize media handling to prevent performance issues
- Use pagination for lists of courses, modules, and lessons

### Security
- Implement proper permission checks for all course management actions
- Sanitize all user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate all uploads for file type and size constraints

## Completion Status

This phase is not yet started. Upon completion, this section will be updated with achievements, challenges addressed, and any pending items.

## Next Steps After Completion
After establishing the course management capabilities, we will move on to Phase 2-2: Course Delivery, building upon the management system to implement the user-facing course experience.
