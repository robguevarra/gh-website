# Admin User Management - Phase 6-4: User Account Reconciliation and Data Synchronization

## Task Objective
Develop specialized tools for identifying, reconciling, and synchronizing user data across different systems (unified_profiles, shopify_orders, ecommerce_orders), ensuring data consistency and enabling administrators to manually link related records when automatic matching fails.

## Current State Assessment
The platform data comes from multiple sources, resulting in potential inconsistencies or duplicate user records under different emails. While the unified data model (Phase 3-0) provides automatic matching based on email addresses, there are edge cases where manual reconciliation is needed. Currently, administrators lack the tools to identify potential matches and manually link records across systems.

## Future State Goal
A comprehensive set of account reconciliation tools that:

1. **Identifies potential matches**: Detects user records across systems that might represent the same person
2. **Presents clear comparison**: Shows matching records side-by-side for easy evaluation
3. **Facilitates manual linking**: Allows administrators to link records with different emails to the same user
4. **Provides data synchronization**: Ensures consistency across all related data after reconciliation
5. **Maintains audit history**: Tracks all reconciliation actions for accountability and troubleshooting
6. **Preserves data integrity**: Prevents accidental data loss during reconciliation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Cross-System Search Interface
- [ ] Create specialized search component
  - Design search interface with multiple criteria (email, name, phone)
  - Implement fuzzy matching to find similar records
  - Add advanced search options for specific edge cases
- [ ] Build results comparison view
  - Create side-by-side comparison of potential matches
  - Highlight similarities and differences between records
  - Implement confidence scoring for match likelihood
- [ ] Develop system source indicators
  - Add clear labeling for data source systems
  - Implement timeline visualization of record creation
  - Show data completeness metrics for each record

### 2. Manual Account Linking
- [ ] Create linking interface
  - Design UI for selecting primary and secondary records
  - Implement confirmation workflow with data preview
  - Add notes field for documenting reconciliation reason
- [ ] Implement secure linking operations
  - Create server action for updating account associations
  - Implement database transactions for atomic operations
  - Add validation to prevent invalid linkages
- [ ] Develop conflict resolution
  - Create UI for resolving field-level conflicts
  - Implement data merging preview
  - Add options for selecting field values from either record

### 3. Data Synchronization Tools
- [ ] Adapt existing sync mechanism
  - Modify `/api/admin/dashboard/sync` for targeted operations
  - Create single-user synchronization endpoints
  - Implement granular sync options (profiles only, orders only, etc.)
- [ ] Build synchronization interface
  - Create UI for initiating and monitoring sync operations
  - Implement progress indicators for long-running syncs
  - Add result summary with success/failure counts
- [ ] Develop error handling
  - Create detailed error reporting for failed sync operations
  - Implement retry functionality for specific operations
  - Add diagnostic tools for troubleshooting sync issues

### 4. Audit and History Tracking
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
  - Create detailed log entries for all reconciliation actions
  - Store before/after states for auditing purposes
  - Add admin attribution for accountability
- [ ] Design history visualization
  - Create timeline view of reconciliation actions
  - Implement filtering by action type and date
  - Add search functionality for finding specific changes
- [ ] Build reversion capabilities
  - Implement undo functionality for recent changes
  - Create restoration workflow for previous states
  - Add confirmation dialogs for critical reversions

### 5. Integration with Existing Views
- [ ] Add reconciliation context to user detail view
  - Create reconciliation history section in user details
  - Implement visual indicators for manually linked accounts
  - Add quick access to reconciliation tools from user detail
- [ ] Enhance user list with reconciliation data
  - Add indicators for potentially duplicated users
  - Implement batch reconciliation from user list
  - Create filtered views for reconciliation candidates
- [ ] Build dashboard metrics
  - Create reconciliation statistics for admin dashboard
  - Implement trend visualization for data consistency
  - Add alerts for potential data issues

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient fuzzy matching algorithms
- Use batch processing for bulk operations
- Optimize database queries for cross-system searches

### Security and Privacy
- Ensure proper authentication for all reconciliation actions
- Implement detailed audit logging for compliance
- Add secure confirmation for critical operations

### Data Integrity
- Use database transactions for all multi-step operations
- Implement backup mechanisms before significant changes
- Add validation to prevent data corruption

### UX Considerations
- Design clear visual cues for match confidence
- Implement intuitive workflows for complex reconciliation
- Provide detailed feedback for all operations

## Completion Criteria
This phase will be considered complete when:

1. Cross-system search successfully identifies potential matches
2. Manual account linking works correctly and safely
3. Data synchronization tools successfully update related records
4. Audit logging captures all reconciliation actions
5. Integration with existing views provides contextual access
6. All operations maintain data integrity and security

## Next Steps After Completion
Proceed with **Phase 6-5: User Management Actions**, implementing comprehensive tools for user editing, access management, and administrative operations.
