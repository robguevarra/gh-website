## Progress Updates

### July 15, 2023
1. **Image Optimization**
   - Replaced `<img>` tags with `next/image` components in `components/checkout/xendit-payment.tsx`
   - Result: Improved image loading performance

2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Implemented dynamic imports for `SocialIntegration` component
   - Result: Reduced initial bundle size

3. **Resource Hints**
   - Added preconnect and preload hints for critical resources in `app/layout.tsx`
   - Result: Performance regression observed, hints were reverted
   - Analysis: The resource hints may have caused additional overhead without providing benefits, possibly due to incorrect prioritization or unnecessary preloading

4. **Critical CSS**
   - Created a separate critical.css file with essential styles for above-the-fold content
   - Modified the import order in layout.tsx to prioritize critical CSS
   - Result: Slight regression in overall performance metrics, but improved First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Analysis: The approach may need refinement, as it didn't yield the expected performance improvements

### March 17, 2025
1. **Comprehensive Performance Optimization**
   - Created custom `OptimizedImage` component with lazy loading and blur-up technique
   - Implemented `DynamicImport` component for lazy loading heavy components
   - Created `createDynamicComponent` utility for code splitting
   - Optimized Next.js configuration for better performance:
     - Enabled CSS optimization with critters
     - Configured console removal in production
     - Optimized package imports for large libraries
   - Added proper resource hints in layout.tsx
   - Implemented font display swap for better font loading
   - Created a directory for non-critical scripts
   - Implemented lazy loading for analytics using Next.js Script component
   - Created comprehensive documentation for performance optimization components
   - Result: Significant improvement in all performance metrics
   - Analysis: The comprehensive approach to performance optimization yielded much better results than individual optimizations

### March 18, 2025
1. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - Created accessible `Heading` component to ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Implemented `SkipLink` component for keyboard navigation
   - Created `VisuallyHidden` component for screen reader accessibility
   - Updated main layout to include skip links and proper landmark regions
   - Enhanced custom cursor toggle with proper ARIA attributes
   - Created color contrast utility functions to ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Implemented keyboard navigation hook for improved keyboard accessibility
   - Result: Improved accessibility across the site
   - Analysis: These foundational accessibility components will help ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Next Steps
1. Implement server-side rendering for dynamic content
2. Optimize third-party scripts
3. Implement caching strategies
4. Focus on accessibility improvements
5. Enhance SEO implementation
6. Set up proper analytics

## Key Deliverables
- Performance audit report and optimization implementation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- Content strategy document and initial content plan
- SEO audit and implementation documentation
- Analytics setup with key events tracking and reporting
