# Course Viewer Optimization - Phase 2: Performance Enhancement

## Task Objective
Develop a comprehensive, industry-leading digital course learning platform with exceptional user experience, focusing on optimizing the CourseViewer component for improved performance, state management, and content rendering.

## Current State Assessment
The current CourseViewer implementation suffers from several critical issues:

1. **State Management Issues**:
   - Infinite loops in component rendering due to improper Zustand store usage
   - Multiple re-renders causing performance degradation
   - Lack of proper selector patterns leading to unnecessary component updates

2. **Content Rendering Challenges**:
   - Raw JSON content being displayed instead of properly rendered lesson content
   - Missing proper handling for content_json data structure
   - Inefficient rendering of lesson materials

3. **Type Safety Concerns**:
   - Inconsistent type definitions across components
   - Missing proper null checks and fallback values
   - Type errors in the course and lesson data structures

4. **User Experience Limitations**:
   - Slow navigation between lessons
   - Incomplete progress tracking implementation
   - Suboptimal mobile responsiveness

## Future State Goal
A premium, high-performance course viewing experience that:

1. **Delivers Exceptional Performance**:
   - Optimized state management with proper Zustand patterns
   - Efficient rendering with minimal re-renders
   - Smooth transitions between lessons and modules

2. **Provides Rich Content Rendering**:
   - Properly rendered HTML content from content_json
   - Support for various content types (text, images, videos)
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

3. **Ensures Type Safety**:
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all components
   - Proper null checks and fallback values
   - Consistent type usage across the application

4. **Creates an Engaging Learning Experience**:
   - Intuitive navigation between lessons and modules
   - Accurate progress tracking and reporting
   - Seamless video playback and content interaction

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes, especially course editor enhancements
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our course viewer approach:
- **Course Structure**: Hierarchical organization with courses, modules, and lessons
- **Technical Foundation**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, Zustand for more complex client-side state

### From Design Context
From the `designContext.md`, these design principles apply:
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchical structure with Inter for body text and Playfair Display for headings
- **Component Patterns**: Consistent styling for cards, buttons, forms, and navigation
- **Animation Principles**: Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from content

### From Previously Completed Phases
The course editor implementation (from `course-editor-enhancement_phase-2_kajabi-like-features.md`) provides:
- **Content Structure**: Three-tier hierarchy with courses, modules, and lessons
- **State Management**: Zustand store patterns for managing course data
- **UI Patterns**: Card-based interfaces with proper loading and error states

## Implementation Plan

### 1. State Management Refactoring

- [x] Refactor CourseViewer component state management:
  - [x] Implement consolidated state management with Zustand
  - [x] Create a single `courseViewerState` object to prevent infinite loops
  - [x] Use proper selector patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - [x] Implement `useMemo` for derived values (sorted modules, lessons)

- [x] Fix infinite loop issues:
  - [x] Refactor all Zustand hooks to use individual selectors
  - [x] Remove problematic patterns where selector functions are passed to other selector functions
  - [x] Ensure each hook returns stable object references

- [x] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces:
  - [x] Create comprehensive type definitions for course, module, and lesson data
  - [x] Add proper default values and null checks to handle potential undefined values
  - [x] Implement defensive programming with fallback empty objects/arrays

### 2. Content Rendering Enhancement

- [x] Implement proper content rendering from content_json:
  - [x] Create content renderer component for lesson content
  - [x] Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render HTML content safely
  - [x] Implement fallback to description if no content_json is available

- [ ] Enhance video player integration:
  - [ ] Implement custom video player with progress tracking
  - [ ] Add support for different video providers (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - [ ] Create responsive video container with proper aspect ratios

- [ ] Add support for rich content types:
  - [ ] Implement proper rendering for images, tables, and lists
  - [ ] Add support for code blocks and syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Create responsive layouts for different content types

### 3. Navigation and Progress Tracking

- [x] Enhance lesson navigation:
  - [x] Implement next/previous lesson navigation
  - [x] Add module navigation in sidebar
  - [x] Create breadcrumb navigation for course hierarchy

- [x] Implement progress tracking:
  - [x] Track lesson completion status
  - [x] Calculate and display module and course progress
  - [x] Implement automatic progress updates based on video watching

- [ ] Add bookmarking and notes:
  - [ ] Create bookmark functionality for lessons
  - [ ] Implement notes feature for students
  - [ ] Add search functionality for notes and bookmarks

### 4. Performance Optimization

- [x] Implement component optimization:
  - [x] Use React.memo for pure components
  - [x] Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
  - [x] Add useCallback for event handlers
  - [x] Fix excessive re-rendering issues in dashboard store hooks
  - [x] Optimize Zustand store selectors to prevent infinite loops
  - [x] Implement refs to prevent redundant data loading

- [x] Optimize state management:
  - [x] Refactor updateLessonProgress to avoid circular dependencies
  - [x] Implement local state updates instead of full data reloads
  - [x] Use direct store selectors instead of custom hooks where appropriate
  - [x] Add proper performance monitoring for hooks
  - [x] Fix logRender implementation to accurately track render counts

- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries:
  - [ ] Implement skeleton loaders for content
  - [ ] Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - [ ] Create fallback UI for network errors

  - [ ] Add suspense boundaries for async components

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use individual selectors for each piece of state to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Maintain stable object references to prevent infinite loops
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks
- Define selector functions outside of hooks to ensure stability
- Use refs to track initialization state and prevent redundant operations
- Avoid circular dependencies in store actions that trigger cascading updates
- Implement local state updates instead of reloading entire data sets

### Content Rendering
- Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with caution, ensuring content is properly sanitized
- Implement responsive design for all content types
- Use proper semantic HTML for accessibility

### Performance
- Monitor render counts with development tools
- Implement virtualization for long lists of modules and lessons
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- Implement custom performance monitoring for hooks to track render counts
- Use refs to prevent redundant data loading and initialization
- Optimize store actions to avoid unnecessary state updates
- Implement proper memoization patterns for derived values
- Use direct store selectors instead of custom hooks for critical components
