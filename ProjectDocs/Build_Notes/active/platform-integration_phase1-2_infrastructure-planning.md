# Platform Integration - Phase 1-2: Infrastructure Planning

## Task Objective
Plan and design the core infrastructure for integrating user management, LMS, email marketing, and e-commerce capabilities into the existing Graceful Homeschooling website, replacing functionality currently provided by systeme.io.

## Current State Assessment
The Graceful Homeschooling website exists as a Next.js 15 application with core pages and design system. User management, course delivery, and email marketing are currently handled by systeme.io, while e-commerce is managed through Shopify. The platform needs to consolidate these functionalities into a cohesive, integrated system.

## Future State Goal
A comprehensive platform built on Next.js that handles all aspects of user management, course delivery, email marketing, and e-commerce integration. This will provide better control over the platform's features and design, while maintaining the current functionality that systeme.io provides.

## Technical Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: Server components with Zustand for client state
- **Email Provider**: Resend.com or SendGrid
- **Payment Processing**: Xendit
- **E-commerce**: Shopify API

### Development Approach
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Server-side rendering where possible for performance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Strict TypeScript typing for better code quality
- Emphasis on reusable components and patterns

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed database schema with SQL definitions
2. Design API endpoints and document specifications
3. Create wireframes for key user interfaces
4. Develop proof-of-concept for Supabase authentication
5. Establish project structure and coding standards

## Open Questions

- What is the expected user volume at launch?
- Are there specific performance requirements for video playback?
- What are the most important email marketing automation features to preserve?
- What reporting capabilities are needed for admins?
- What is the priority order for feature implementation?
