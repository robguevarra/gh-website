# Platform Integration - Phase 1-2: Infrastructure Planning

## Task Objective
Create a detailed infrastructure plan for implementing the architecture designed in Phase 1-1, focusing on the technical requirements and specifications for each component of the Graceful Homeschooling platform.

## Current State Assessment
The high-level architecture plan is complete (Phase 1-1), outlining the major components and their relationships. We now need to define the specific infrastructure requirements, technical specifications, and implementation approach for each component before beginning development.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router and React Server Components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: Server components with Zustand for client-side state
- **Payment Processing**: Xendit
- **E-commerce**: Shopify API integration

### Development Approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Server components for static and data-fetch operations
- Client components only where interactivity is required
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Feature flagging for phased rollout

## Next Steps
Once the infrastructure planning is complete, we will proceed to implementing the database schema (Phase 1-3), followed by the authentication system (Phase 1-4).

## Open Questions

- What is the expected user volume at launch?
- Are there specific performance requirements for video playback?
- What are the most important email marketing automation features to preserve?
- What reporting capabilities are needed for admins?
- What is the priority order for feature implementation?
