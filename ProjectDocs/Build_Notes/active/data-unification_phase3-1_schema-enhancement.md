# Data Unification - Phase 3-1: Database Schema Enhancement

## Task Objective
Implement the database schema changes necessary to create a unified data model that combines information from Xendit and Systemeio into a consistent, normalized structure for business intelligence and admin dashboard features.

## Current State Assessment
Based on the data unification strategy defined in Phase 3-0, we have two primary data sources (Xendit and Systemeio) with separate table structures. The Xendit table contains payment transaction data as the source of truth for payments, while the Systemeio table contains user profile information. Currently, there's no formal schema that properly relates these data sources or transforms the raw data into a structure optimized for business intelligence.

## Future State Goal
A properly normalized database schema with:
1. A unified user profile table that combines information from both sources
2. A standardized transactions table for payment data
3. A properly structured enrollments table connecting users to courses
4. Appropriate indexes and relationships for efficient querying
5. Views or materialized views for common dashboard queries

This enhanced schema will enable efficient querying for the admin dashboard while maintaining data integrity and supporting future platform growth.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Data Unification Strategy (Phase 3-0)
> 2. Architecture Planning (Phase 1-1)
> 3. Project Context (`ProjectContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Data Unification Strategy
The strategy established:
- Email as the primary matching key between systems
- Clear data precedence rules (Xendit for payments, Systemeio for profiles)
- Validation rules for data types and formats
- Historical data preservation requirements

### From Architecture Planning
The database architecture includes:
- Core user table leveraging Supabase Auth with extension for profile data
- Normalized transaction and enrollment models
- Appropriate indexing for query performance

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Unified User Profiles Table (Executed)

#### Table: unified_profiles
- **Fields:**
  - `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY (references `auth.users.id` where available)
  - `email` TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE (indexed, lowercased, trimmed)
  - `first_name` TEXT
  - `last_name` TEXT
  - `phone` TEXT
  - `tags` TEXT[] (normalized tags from Systemeio)
  - `acquisition_source` TEXT (e.g., 'squeeze', 'Canva', etc.)
  - `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() (UTC)
  - `updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() (UTC)
- **Indexes:**
  - CREATE INDEX ON `unified_profiles` (`email`)

BEGIN
  -- If transaction_type is a course, create enrollment for user
  -- Update enrollment status if payment status changes
  -- Insert notification for admin if needed
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER after_transaction_insert
AFTER INSERT ON transactions
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_transaction_insert();

- [x] Implement `after_profile_update` trigger

### 7. Create Database Migrations
- [ ] Develop schema migration scripts:
  - Create tables with proper types and constraints
  - Add indexes and foreign keys
  - Create views and functions
- [ ] Create test data validation scripts:
  - Verify data consistency after migration
  - Check referential integrity
  - Validate business rules

## Technical Considerations

### Schema Design Principles
1. **Normalization Level**:
   - Use 3NF (Third Normal Form) for most tables
   - Consider denormalization only where performance requires it
   - Document any denormalization decisions

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Use specific PostgreSQL types (not just TEXT for everything)
   - Implement proper precision for numeric fields
   - Use TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamp fields to handle timezones

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use snake_case for all database objects
   - Prefix views with 'v_' for clarity
   - Use plural for table names, singular for column names
   - Be consistent with abbreviations

### Performance Considerations
1. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Index fields used in WHERE clauses and joins
   - Consider partial indexes for filtered queries
   - Use composite indexes for multi-column filters
   - Document expected query patterns for each index

2. **View Performance**:
   - Consider materialized views for expensive calculations
   - Implement refresh strategies for materialized views
   - Document refresh frequency requirements

### Security and Access Control
1. **Row-Level Security**:
   - Implement RLS policies for sensitive tables
   - Document policy intentions and test cases
   - Consider admin override capabilities

2. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Define appropriate database roles
   - Document permission grants
   - Consider service roles for application access

## Completion Status

This phase is currently in progress. Tasks completed:
- Initial schema design for unified_profiles table
- Preliminary indexing strategy

Challenges identified:
- Handling historical data during migration
- Optimizing view performance for dashboard queries
- Balancing normalization with query performance

## Next Steps After Completion
After implementing the database schema enhancements, we will move to Phase 3-2: Data Migration Implementation, which will populate the new schema with data from the existing Xendit and Systemeio tables.

// Update: This build note has been reviewed and updated for full alignment with the completed Phase 3-0 strategy plan.
// Key enhancements:
// - `unified_profiles` table includes a `tags` array (text[]) for normalized user tags (see Phase 3-0 Data Model Design).
// - All `status` fields in `transactions` and `enrollments` use the normalized enum: 'completed', 'pending', 'expired'.
// - All timestamp fields are TIMESTAMPTZ and stored in UTC (ISO 8601).
// - Audit logging and error handling are required for all migration and trigger logic.
// - All schema, migration, and function design decisions are traceable to Phase 3-0 for audit and onboarding.
// - See Phase 3-0 for field mapping, normalization, and transformation rules.
