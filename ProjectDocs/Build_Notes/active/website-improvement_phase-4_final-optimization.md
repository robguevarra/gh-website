# Final Performance Optimization

## Task Objective
Conduct final performance optimization to ensure the website meets or exceeds industry standards for speed and responsiveness.

## Current State Assessment
Basic performance optimizations have been implemented, but further refinement is needed to achieve excellence in Core Web Vitals and overall performance.

## Future State Goal
An exceptionally fast and responsive website with excellent Core Web Vitals scores that provides a smooth experience regardless of device or connection speed.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Final Performance Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits for all key pages
- [ ] Use WebPageTest for detailed analysis
