# Platform Integration - Phase 1-1: Architecture Planning

## Task Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive platform that integrates user management, LMS functionality, email marketing, custom checkout, and Shopify integration into the existing Graceful Homeschooling website.

## Current State Assessment
The Graceful Homeschooling website currently exists as a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI components. It has a homepage and product page (Papers to Profits) with payment processing integration. The site follows a defined design system with brand colors, typography, and component patterns. Currently, systeme.io is being used for user management, LMS, and email marketing, which we aim to replace with our own implementation.

## Future State Goal
A fully integrated platform where users can sign up, purchase courses, access course content based on their membership tier, receive automated emails, and access members-only Shopify products - all within a cohesive experience that matches the existing design system. The platform will handle user management, course delivery, email marketing, and e-commerce while allowing admins to manage all aspects through an intuitive admin interface.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Setup (Supabase)
