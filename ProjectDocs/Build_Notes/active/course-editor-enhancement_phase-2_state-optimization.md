# Course Editor Enhancement - Phase 2: State Optimization

## Task Objective
Optimize state management and data fetching in the course editor to eliminate redundant API calls and improve performance.

## Current State Assessment
- Multiple redundant API calls on page load/refresh (still occurring)
- State transformation happening multiple times
- Initial caching implementation added but not fully effective
- Zustand store hydration implemented but needs refinement
- Unnecessary re-renders still occurring

## Future State Goal
- Single API call on initial load
- Proper state caching and hydration
- Optimized state transformations
- Clear separation of concerns between data fetching and UI

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Optimize Zustand Store ‚è≥ In Progress
- [x] Implement proper hydration in course store
- [x] Add middleware for state persistence
- [x] Add request deduplication
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Fix multiple re-renders issue
- [ ] Investigate hydration timing issues

### 2. Optimize Data Fetching ‚è≥ In Progress
- [x] Implement request caching
- [x] Add request cancellation for stale requests
- [x] Add proper loading states
- [x] Implement optimistic updates
- [ ] Fix duplicate API calls issue
- [ ] Add proper request queuing
- [ ] Implement proper request deduplication at router level

### 3. State Transformation Optimization üîÑ Next Up
- [ ] Move transformations to store actions
- [ ] Implement memoization for expensive transformations
- [ ] Add proper type safety without any casting
- [ ] Implement proper null checks
- [ ] Add transformation caching
- [ ] Optimize transformation timing

### 4. Component Optimization üîÑ Next Up
- [ ] Implement proper dependency management
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add proper type safety
- [ ] Add component-level memoization
- [ ] Optimize re-render triggers

### 5. Testing and Validation üîÑ Next Up
- [ ] Add unit tests for store
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Validate performance improvements
- [ ] Document optimization strategies

## Current Issues
1. Multiple API Calls Issue:
   - Still seeing 3-4 API calls on page load
   - Need to investigate component mount sequence
   - Need to check effect dependencies
   - Possible race condition in hydration

2. Performance Issues:
   - State transformations happening too frequently
   - Cache not preventing all duplicate requests
   - Hydration timing causing extra renders

## Next Steps
1. Fix Multiple API Calls:
   - [ ] Add request queue to prevent parallel calls
   - [ ] Implement proper request deduplication
   - [ ] Add request batching
   - [ ] Fix hydration timing

2. Optimize State Management:
   - [ ] Move state transformations to actions
   - [ ] Add proper memoization
   - [ ] Implement proper dependency tracking
   - [ ] Add state persistence optimization

3. Improve Error Handling:
   - [ ] Add proper error boundaries
   - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms
   - [ ] Add proper error recovery
   - [ ] Improve error messages
