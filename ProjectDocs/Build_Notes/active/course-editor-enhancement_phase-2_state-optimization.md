# Course Editor Enhancement - Phase 2: State Optimization

## Task Objective
Optimize state management, data fetching, error handling, and component structure in the course editor.

## Current State Assessment
- âœ… Eliminated redundant API calls
- âœ… Consolidated state transformations
- âœ… Implemented caching for better performance
- âœ… Refactored course store into modular structure
- âœ… Fixed type safety issues in course store
- âœ… Implemented error boundaries for better error handling
- âœ… Added proper type guards for view mode switching
- âœ… Fixed infinite update loop in content editor
- âœ… Improved lesson loading and synchronization
- âœ… Enhanced state management between store and editor
- âœ… Optimized content editor state updates

## Future State Goal
- âœ… Single API call on initial load
- âœ… Optimized state transformations
- âœ… Proper error boundaries and error handling
- âœ… Type-safe implementation
- âœ… Efficient content editor state management
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive testing coverage
- ðŸ”„ Performance monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Modular component structure

## Implementation Plan

1. State Management Optimization
