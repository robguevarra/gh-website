# Course Editor Enhancement - Phase 2: State Optimization

## Task Objective
Optimize state management, data fetching, and error handling in the course editor.

## Current State Assessment
- âœ… Eliminated redundant API calls
- âœ… Consolidated state transformations
- âœ… Implemented caching for better performance
- âœ… Refactored course store into modular structure
- âœ… Fixed type safety issues in course store
- âœ… Implemented error boundaries for better error handling
- âœ… Added proper type guards for view mode switching

## Future State Goal
- âœ… Single API call on initial load
- âœ… Optimized state transformations
- âœ… Proper error boundaries and error handling
- âœ… Type-safe implementation
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive testing coverage
- ðŸ”„ Performance monitoring

## Implementation Plan

1. State Management Optimization
   - âœ… Eliminate redundant API calls
   - âœ… Consolidate state transformations
   - âœ… Implement caching
   - âœ… Add pending operations tracking
   - âœ… Ensure proper type safety

2. Error Handling Enhancement
   - âœ… Implement error boundaries
   - âœ… Add proper error logging
   - âœ… Improve error messages
   - âœ… Handle edge cases gracefully
   - ðŸ”„ Add error reporting service integration

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - ðŸ”„ Set up unit testing framework
   - ðŸ”„ Add integration tests
   - ðŸ”„ Implement E2E tests
   - ðŸ”„ Add performance tests

4. Performance Monitoring
   - ðŸ”„ Add performance metrics tracking
   - ðŸ”„ Implement monitoring dashboard
   - ðŸ”„ Set up alerts for performance degradation

## Current Issues
- None pending

## Recent Improvements
1. Fixed race condition by adding pending operations tracking
2. Improved type safety with proper type definitions and null checks
3. Implemented error boundaries for better error handling
4. Added type guards for view mode switching

## Next Focus
1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Add error reporting service integration

## Lessons Learned
