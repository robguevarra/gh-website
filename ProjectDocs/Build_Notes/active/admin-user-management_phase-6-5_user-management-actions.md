# Admin User Management - Phase 6-5: User Management Actions

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive set of administrative actions that enable administrators to efficiently manage user accounts, including editing profile information, managing access permissions, and performing administrative operations such as password resets and account status changes.

## Current State Assessment
The user detail view implemented in Phase 6-3 provides a comprehensive view of user information, and the reconciliation tools from Phase 6-4 allow administrators to link accounts across systems. However, administrators still lack the ability to directly modify user data, manage access permissions, or perform critical account operations. These capabilities are essential for effective user management.

## Future State Goal
A complete set of user management actions that:

1. **Enables secure profile editing**: Allows administrators to modify user profile information with proper validation
2. **Provides access control**: Enables granting or revoking specific permissions and feature access
3. **Facilitates account management**: Supports administrative operations like password resets and status changes
4. **Maintains security**: Implements proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging
5. **Ensures data integrity**: Prevents unintended consequences of administrative actions
6. **Provides clear feedback**: Communicates the results of actions to administrators

## Implementation Plan

### 1. User Profile Editing
- [ ] Create secure editing interface
  - Build form components with proper validation
  - Implement server actions for secure updates
  - Add field-level permissions for sensitive data
- [ ] Develop validation logic
  - Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback
  - Create server-side validation for security
  - Add specialized validation for restricted fields
- [ ] Build change preview and confirmation
  - Create visual diff of proposed changes
  - Implement confirmation workflow for significant changes
  - Add reason documentation for audit purposes

### 2. Access Management
- [ ] Implement permission system
  - Create permission management interface
  - Implement role-based access control
  - Add custom permission assignments
- [ ] Develop feature access controls
  - Build UI for enabling/disabling feature access
  - Implement time-limited access capabilities
  - Create bulk permission operations
- [ ] Add subscription and tier management
  - Create interface for adjusting subscription tiers
  - Implement trial extension capabilities
  - Add expiration management for time-limited access

### 3. Account Status Management
- [ ] Build account status controls
  - Create interface for activating/deactivating accounts
  - Implement account suspension with reason documentation
  - Add temporary status changes with automatic expiration
- [ ] Develop verification workflow
  - Implement manual verification process for accounts
  - Create email verification bypass for administrators
  - Add verification badges and indicators
- [ ] Create account security tools
  - Implement forced password reset functionality
  - Add session management with termination capability
  - Create security flag system for suspicious activity

### 4. Communication Tools
- [ ] Implement direct messaging
  - Create administrator-to-user messaging interface
  - Implement email notification templates
  - Add message history tracking
- [ ] Build notification management
  - Create interface for managing user notifications
  - Implement override capabilities for notification preferences
  - Add bulk notification generation
- [ ] Develop communication templates
  - Create reusable message templates for common scenarios
  - Implement variable substitution for personalization
  - Add template management interface

### 5. Bulk Operations
- [ ] Create bulk editing capabilities
  - Implement multi-select from user list
  - Create batch update interface with validation
  - Add confirmation workflow for bulk operations
- [ ] Develop segmentation tools
  - Create saved filters for common user segments
  - Implement dynamic segment creation
  - Add bulk actions targeted to segments
- [ ] Build batch processing
  - Implement background processing for large operations
  - Create progress tracking and notification
  - Add error handling and partial completion support

### 6. Audit and Security
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
  - Create detailed logs for all administrative actions
  - Store before/after states for all changes
  - Add administrator attribution and timestamps
- [ ] Build security controls
  - Implement permission checks for all sensitive operations
  - Create approval workflow for critical actions
  - Add IP logging and unusual activity detection
- [ ] Develop compliance features
  - Create data export tools for user data requests
  - Implement data retention controls
  - Add privacy policy acknowledgment tracking

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient batch processing for bulk operations
- Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Optimize database operations for commonly performed actions

### Security and Privacy
- Ensure proper authentication for all administrative actions
- Implement least privilege principle for admin permissions
- Add confirmation workflows for sensitive operations

### Data Integrity
- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Implement validation at all levels (client, server, database)
- Add safeguards against common errors (e.g., duplicate emails)

### UX Considerations
- Design clear visual feedback for action results
- Implement intuitive workflows for complex operations
- Provide contextual help for administrative functions

## Completion Criteria
This phase will be considered complete when:

1. User profile editing works correctly with proper validation
2. Access management tools enable granular permission control
3. Account status management functions as expected
4. Communication tools successfully deliver messages
5. Bulk operations process data correctly and efficiently
6. Audit logging captures all administrative actions
7. Security controls prevent unauthorized operations

## Next Steps After Completion
Proceed with **Phase 6-6: User Analytics and Reporting**, implementing tools for data visualization, trend analysis, and report generation to provide insights about the user base.
