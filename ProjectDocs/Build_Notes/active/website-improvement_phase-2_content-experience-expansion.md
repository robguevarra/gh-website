# Content & Experience Expansion

## Task Objective
Expand the content offerings and user experience of the Graceful Homeschooling website by implementing an educational resources library, blog platform, user accounts system, basic community features, and enhanced visual design elements.

## Current State Assessment
The Graceful Homeschooling website currently has limited content structure focused primarily on the homepage and a single product page (Papers to Profits). The site lacks educational resources, a blog, user accounts, and community features. The design system is established but lacks some advanced visual elements.

## Future State Goal
A content-rich platform with a comprehensive educational resources library, engaging blog content, fully functional user accounts, basic community discussion capabilities, and enhanced visual design elements including custom illustrations and icons.
