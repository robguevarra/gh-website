# Shopify E-commerce Integration - Phase 5-2-4: Collection-Based Filtering

## Task Objective
Replace the hardcoded category navigation in the member-facing storefront (`/dashboard/store`) with dynamic filtering based on actual Shopify Collections. This involves syncing product collection data to Supabase and updating the frontend to fetch, display, and filter by these collections.

## Current State Assessment
- The storefront used a `CategoryNavigation.tsx` component with hardcoded categories.
- The Supabase `shopify_products` table lacked collection data.
- Filtering was primarily search-based (`q` parameter).

## Future State Goal
1.  **Collection Data in Supabase:** Achieved. `shopify_products` table has `collection_handles TEXT[]` column.
2.  **Updated Sync Function:** Achieved. `shopify-sync` Edge Function fetches and stores collection handles.
3.  **Dynamic Category Navigation:** Achieved. `CategoryNavigation.tsx` displays buttons based on fetched collection handles.
4.  **Collection Filtering:** Achieved. Selecting a collection updates the URL (`?collection=handle`) and filters products server-side.
5.  **Integrated Filtering Logic:** Achieved. Store page handles filtering by `collection` or `q` parameter, mutually exclusively.

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1.  Phase 5-0: Strategy & Architecture - Defines Shopify as PIM, custom store approach.
> 2.  Phase 5-1: Backend Setup - Initial product sync setup.
> 3.  Phase 5-2: Frontend Core - `ProductList`, `Cart` components.
> 4.  Phase 5-2-1 to 5-2-3: Storefront Enhancements - UI structure, existing filtering/search components (`StoreStickyBar`, `StoreResultsManager`), `CategoryNavigation` component.
> 5.  Project Context (`ProjectContext.md`) - Tech stack (Next.js App Router, Supabase, RSC), data models.
> 6.  Design Context (`designContext.md`) - UI patterns (Shadcn).
> 7.  Build Notes Guidelines (`build-notes-guidelines.md`) - Documentation standards.
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### Key Dependencies
- Modifications to the Supabase Edge Function (`shopify-sync`).
- Supabase database schema modification.
- Updates to server-side data fetching logic in Next.js (`/dashboard/store/page.tsx`).
- Updates to client-side components (`CategoryNavigation.tsx`, `StoreStickyBar.tsx`).

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend: Schema & Sync Update
    *   [x] **Migration:** Add `collection_handles TEXT[] NULL` column and GIN index to `public.shopify_products`. (Executed directly via MCP tool as per user instruction)
    *   [x] **Update Sync Function (`shopify-sync`):** Modify GraphQL query (`index.ts`) and upsert logic (`utils.ts`) to fetch and store collection handles.
    *   [x] **Deploy & Backfill:** Deploy updated function and trigger backfill. (Completed)

### 2. Frontend: Fetch & Display Collections
    *   [x] **Fetch Distinct Collections (`/dashboard/store/page.tsx`):** Implement `getStoreCollections` function using `.select('collection_handles')` and JS processing (used `as any` due to temporarily out-of-sync TS types).
    *   [x] **Update `CategoryNavigation.tsx`:** Modify props (`collections`, `activeCollectionHandle`), remove hardcoded data, map over fetched collections, add "All Designs" option.

### 3. Frontend: Implement Filtering Logic
    *   [x] **Update Store Page (`/dashboard/store/page.tsx`):** Modify `getStoreProducts` to accept filter object; add `.filter('collection_handles', 'cs', ...)` logic; update `Promise.all` call; pass props to `CategoryNavigation`.
    *   [x] **Update `StoreStickyBar.tsx`:** Implement `updateUrlParams` to handle `q` and `collection` mutually exclusively; update search/clear handlers.
    *   [x] **Update `CategoryNavigation.tsx`:** Add `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams`; implement `handleCollectionClick` to update URL query params (`?collection=handle`) and clear `q` param, using `router.push`.

## Technical Considerations

### Data Consistency
- Ensure the `shopify-sync` function correctly handles products belonging to multiple collections.
- Plan for how to handle collection deletion/renaming in Shopify.

### Performance
- Index the `collection_handles` column in Supabase (GIN index added).
- The query for distinct collection handles should be monitored for performance.

### User Experience
- Clearly indicate the active filter (collection or search term).
- Implemented mutually exclusive filtering for now.
- Added "All Designs" option to clear collection filter.
- Added smooth scroll to results after filtering.

### Troubleshooting Notes & Learnings
- **Empty Error Object (`{}`) from Supabase:** Initially encountered when filtering by collection. While often caused by RLS, in this case (with RLS confirmed off), it was misleading. The root cause was later identified as an invalid comment within the `.select()` string literal (`PGRST100` parsing error).
- **Supabase JS Filter Operators (`cs` vs. `@>`):** Encountered `PGRST100` error ("unexpected '@'") when attempting to use the PostgreSQL operator `@>` directly in `.filter()`. Confirmed that the correct Supabase JS client operator string for array containment is `cs`. The direct SQL test with `@>` worked due to bypassing the JS client's parser/translator.
- **Type Safety (`as any`):** Adding the `collection_handles` column directly via SQL (instead of migration + type regen) caused TypeScript errors because generated types were out of sync. Used `as any` as a temporary workaround in `getStoreCollections` but recommended regenerating types (`npx supabase gen types...`) for long-term safety.
- **Syntax within `.select()`:** Comments (`// ...`) are **not** allowed inside the backtick string passed to the `.select()` method. This caused a `PGRST100` parsing error.

## Completion Status
**Completed.** All tasks implemented successfully. Collection-based filtering is functional.

## Next Steps After Completion
Proceed with the next phase of the Shopify E-commerce Integration (e.g., Phase 5-3: Checkout & Payment Integration) or address any further UI refinements for the store.
