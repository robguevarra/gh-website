# Platform Integration - Phase 2-2: Unified Course Editor & Content Management

## Task Objective
Create a unified, intuitive interface for managing courses, modules, and lessons with integrated rich text editing capabilities for the Graceful Homeschooling platform.

## Current State Assessment
The platform has basic course and lesson management functionality but lacks a cohesive editing experience. The current implementation is:
- Fragmented across multiple pages and components
- Missing rich text editing capabilities
- Lacks real-time preview and seamless content management

## Future State Goal
A unified course management system that provides:

1. **Single-Page Course Editor**:
   - Unified interface for managing course structure and content
   - Real-time preview of course content

2. **Integrated Rich Text Editor**:
   - Modern WYSIWYG editing experience
   - Support for media embedding
   - Real-time collaboration capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```typescript
app/
  admin/
    courses/
      _components/
        CourseEditor/
          index.tsx              # Main editor component
          Navigation.tsx         # Course structure navigation
          ContentEditor.tsx      # TipTap editor wrapper
          MediaManager.tsx       # Media handling component
          Preview.tsx           # Live preview component
      [courseId]/
        page.tsx                # Course editor page
        loading.tsx             # Loading state
        error.tsx              # Error handling
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Rich text content storage
ALTER TABLE lessons ADD COLUMN content_json JSONB;
ALTER TABLE lessons ADD COLUMN version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

-- Media management
CREATE TABLE media_assets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
