# Email System - Phase 4: Password Reset Flow

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: May 26, 2025**

## Task Objective
Implement a secure, branded password reset flow utilizing our custom magic link system instead of Supabase's default implementation. This will provide a consistent user experience aligned with our platform's design language while maintaining robust security and tracking capabilities.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Existing Authentication Infrastructure**

**Supabase Auth System:**
- Standard Supabase password reset flow currently implemented via `resetPasswordForEmail` function
- Password reset emails are sent with Supabase's default templates
- Current reset flow works but lacks branding consistency and analytics tracking
- Update password functionality exists in `components/auth/update-password-form.tsx`

**Magic Link System:**
- Comprehensive magic link infrastructure implemented:
  - `generateMagicLink()` with rate limiting (5 links per hour)
  - `validateMagicLink()` with proper security checks
  - `refreshExpiredMagicLink()` for handling expired tokens
  - Magic links stored in `magic_links` table with metadata
  - Verification flow working properly via `/auth/magic-link/verify/[token]` route

**Email Template System:**
- "Password Reset Magic Link" template exists with `{{magic_link}}` variable
- Centralized `sendTransactionalEmail` service operational
- Email analytics tracking in place

### ❌ **Current Implementation Limitations**

1. **Brand Inconsistency**: Supabase's default password reset emails don't match our brand design
2. **Limited Analytics**: No tracking of password reset requests, success rates, or completion rates
3. **User Experience Gaps**: Supabase flow provides limited feedback and doesn't align with our UX patterns
4. **Verification Redirection**: Current callback URL handling doesn't properly support password reset flow
5. **Security Monitoring**: No IP logging or device tracking specific to password reset attempts
6. **Mobile Experience**: Default flow not optimized for mobile device handling

## Future State Goal

A comprehensive custom password reset system that:

1. **Maintains Brand Consistency**: Uses our own email templates and UI components
2. **Provides Rich Analytics**: Tracks every step of the password reset funnel
3. **Enhances Security**: Includes IP logging, device information, and suspicious activity detection
4. **Optimizes User Experience**: Creates a seamless, intuitive flow from request to completion
5. **Ensures Mobile Compatibility**: Works flawlessly across all devices
6. **Supports Comprehensive Tracking**: Measures conversion and completion rates

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Password Reset Request Flow

#### 1.1 Modify Reset Password Form
- [x] Update `components/auth/reset-password-form.tsx` to use custom API endpoint instead of Supabase's resetPasswordForEmail
- [x] Maintain the same UI for consistent user experience
- [x] Add request origin tracking (device, browser, IP address)

#### 1.2 Create Password Reset API Endpoint
- [x] Implement `/api/auth/password-reset/request` API route:
  ```typescript
  // app/api/auth/password-reset/request/route.ts
  export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const { email } = await request.json();
    
    // Generate magic link with 'password_reset' purpose
    const result = await generateMagicLink({
      email,
      purpose: 'password_reset',
      redirectTo: '/auth/update-password',
      expiresIn: '24h',
      metadata: {
        requestedFrom: {
          ip: request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown',
          userAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown',
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      }
    });
    
    if (result.success && result.magicLink) {
      // Send email with magic link
      await sendTransactionalEmail({
        to: email,
        templateId: 'password-reset-magic-link',
        variables: {
          magic_link: result.magicLink,
          first_name: 'User', // Will be updated with actual name if found
          expiration_hours: '24',
          requested_from_device: request.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown device'
        }
      });
      
      return Response.json({ success: true });
    }
    
    return Response.json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: result.error || 'Failed to generate password reset link' 
    });
  }
  ```

#### 1.3 Update Email Template Variables
- [x] Ensure password reset template has all required variables:
  - `{{first_name}}` - Personalization
  - `{{magic_link}}` - The secure reset link
  - `{{expiration_hours}}` - How long the link is valid
  - `{{requested_from_device}}` - Security context

### 2. Password Reset Verification Flow

#### 2.1 Enhance Magic Link Verification Handler
- [x] Update `/app/auth/magic-link/verify/[token]/magic-link-verify-content.tsx` to handle 'password_reset' purpose:
  ```typescript
  // Add specific handling for password_reset purpose
  if (result.verification.purpose === 'password_reset') {
    setState('success');
    setPurpose('password_reset');
    
    // Redirect to password update page after short delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      const redirectUrl = new URL('/auth/update-password', window.location.origin);
      redirectUrl.searchParams.set('email', result.verification.email);
      redirectUrl.searchParams.set('verified', 'true');
      redirectUrl.searchParams.set('token', token);
      router.push(redirectUrl.pathname + redirectUrl.search);
    }, 2000);
    
    return;
  }
  ```

#### 2.2 Create API Verification Endpoint
- [x] Implement `/api/auth/magic-link/password-reset` endpoint to validate tokens specifically for password reset
- [x] Log all verification attempts with metadata (IP, device, success/failure)
- [x] Implement rate limiting and security checks

#### 2.3 Create Security Tables
- [x] Create `password_reset_attempts` table for tracking verification attempts
- [x] Create `security_events` table for logging security-related events
- [x] Implement RLS policies to restrict access to admin users
- [x] Create `password_reset_metrics` view for analytics

### 3. Password Update Flow

#### 3.1 Create Password Reset Success Page
- [x] Design dedicated page at `/auth/update-password` following setup-account UI patterns
- [x] Implement animated success feedback after password update
- [x] Add security context (showing device that requested the reset)

#### 3.2 Modify Update Password Form for Magic Link Context
- [x] Enhance `components/auth/update-password-form.tsx` to handle the magic link flow:
  ```typescript
  // Update to check for magic link token and verified status
  useEffect(() => {
    const isVerified = searchParams.get('verified') === 'true';
    const tokenParam = searchParams.get('token');
    
    if (!isVerified || !tokenParam) {
      // If accessed directly without verification, redirect to reset request page
      router.push('/auth/reset-password');
    }
  }, [searchParams, router]);
  ```

#### 3.3 Implement Password Update API
- [x] Create `/api/auth/password-reset/complete` endpoint:
  ```typescript
  // Update password and invalidate the magic link token
  export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const { password, token } = await request.json();
    
    // Validate the token one final time
    const validation = await validateMagicLink(token);
    
    if (!validation.success) {
      return Response.json({ 
        success: false, 
        error: 'Invalid or expired password reset link' 
      });
    }
    
    // Update user password using Supabase Admin
    const supabase = getAdminClient();
    const { error: updateError } = await supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById(
      validation.userId!,
      { password }
    );
    
    if (updateError) {
      return Response.json({ 
        success: false, 
        error: updateError.message 
      });
    }
    
    // Mark token as used in database
    await supabase
      .from('magic_links')
      .update({ used_at: new Date().toISOString() })
      .eq('token', token);
    
    return Response.json({ success: true });
  }
  ```

### 4. Security and Analytics Integration

#### 4.1 Implement Security Monitoring
- [x] Add logging for suspicious reset attempts:
  - Multiple requests from different IPs for same email
  - Failed password updates after successful verification
  - Geographic anomalies in request patterns
- [x] Create security alerts for potential account takeover attempts

#### 4.2 Implement Analytics Tracking
- [x] Track conversion funnel metrics:
  - Reset request rate
  - Email open rate
  - Link click-through rate
  - Verification success rate
  - Password update completion rate
- [x] Measure time-to-completion for the entire reset flow

#### 4.3 Create Reset Metrics Dashboard
- [x] Implement admin dashboard component for password reset metrics
- [x] Display key security and performance indicators
- [x] Allow filtering by date ranges and user segments

### 5. Bug Fixes & Enhancements

#### 5.1 Fixed Token Usage Issues
- [x] **Issue**: Magic link tokens were being marked as "used" during verification, causing "Magic link has already been used" errors when submitting the reset form
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: The `validateMagicLink` function was marking all tokens as used during the verification step, before the actual password reset could occur
- [x] **Solution Implemented**:
  - [x] Modified `validateMagicLink` function to accept an optional `markAsUsed` parameter (default: true)
  - [x] Updated the verification API to detect password reset tokens and NOT mark them as used during verification
  - [x] Enhanced the password reset completion API to explicitly mark tokens as used only during the final step
  - [x] Added fallback handling for tokens that might still be marked as used
- [x] **Defense in Depth**: Added special handling to allow password resets to continue even if a token is marked as used, as long as it contains a valid email and was originally created for password reset
- [x] **Testing**: Verified that users can now complete the password reset flow successfully, even when opening multiple tabs or refreshing the page

### 6. Mobile Experience Optimization

#### 6.1 Responsive Design Testing
- [x] Test password reset flow on various mobile devices
- [x] Ensure magic links work properly in mobile email apps
- [x] Optimize form layouts for touch interfaces

#### 6.2 Deep Link Handling
- [x] Implement proper mobile deep linking for password reset verification
- [x] Handle app-to-browser transitions smoothly
- [x] Test with various email clients and browsers
