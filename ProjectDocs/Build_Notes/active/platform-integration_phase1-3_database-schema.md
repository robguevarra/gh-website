# Platform Integration - Phase 1-3: Database Schema Implementation

## Task Objective
Design and implement the core database schema for the Graceful Homeschooling platform using Supabase PostgreSQL, focusing on user management, course content, and e-commerce functionality.

## Current State Assessment
The application currently relies on external services (systeme.io) for user and content management. We need to design a comprehensive database schema that will support all platform features while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Future State Goal
A fully implemented database schema in Supabase that supports all platform features including user management, course content, email marketing, and e-commerce integration.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core User Tables
- [ ] Implement profiles table extending Supabase auth.users
- [ ] Create row-level security policies for user data
- [ ] Set up membership tier tracking columns
- [ ] Implement admin role management

### 2. Course and Content Tables
- [ ] Create courses table with proper fields
- [ ] Implement modules table for course sections
- [ ] Design lessons table with content and video fields
- [ ] Set up progress tracking tables
- [ ] Create comment/discussion tables

### 3. E-commerce Tables
- [ ] Implement products table for courses and memberships
- [ ] Create payment transactions table
- [ ] Set up subscription tracking
- [ ] Design order management schema

### 4. Email Marketing Tables
- [ ] Create email templates table
- [ ] Implement campaign tracking tables
- [ ] Design automation workflow tables
- [ ] Set up email analytics tables

### 5. Security Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement row-level security for all tables
- [ ] Create database functions for common operations
- [ ] Set up triggers for automated actions
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery processes

## Technical Decisions
- Use UUID primary keys for all tables
- Implement JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Create appropriate indexes for performance
- Use row-level security for all tables
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps for all tables

## Next Steps
1. Implement core user tables
2. Set up row-level security
3. Create database migrations
4. Test basic database operations
