# Platform Integration - Phase 1-4: Authentication System

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive authentication system for the Graceful Homeschooling platform using Supabase Auth, including sign-up, login, password management, and role-based access control.

## Current State Assessment
Authentication is currently handled by systeme.io, with no direct integration into our Next.js application. We need to implement a custom authentication system that provides a seamless experience while maintaining security.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional authentication system integrated with our Next.js application, providing secure user management, role-based access control, and a smooth user experience.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Supabase Auth Setup
- [ ] Configure Supabase project for authentication
- [ ] Set up email templates for auth emails
- [ ] Configure OAuth providers if needed
- [ ] Set up security settings and policies

### 2. Authentication Components
- [ ] Create sign-up form with validation
- [ ] Implement login component
- [ ] Build password reset flow
- [ ] Design email verification process
- [ ] Implement remember me functionality

### 3. Session Management
- [ ] Set up authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement protected routes
- [ ] Create session persistence logic
- [ ] Build authentication context provider
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism

### 4. User Profile Integration
- [ ] Connect auth system with user profiles
- [ ] Create initial profile setup flow
- [ ] Implement profile editing
- [ ] Build account settings page
- [ ] Create avatar/image upload

### 5. Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Define permission structure
- [ ] Implement role-based UI rendering
- [ ] Create admin authentication
- [ ] Build permission checking helpers
- [ ] Set up route guards for protected areas

## Technical Decisions
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication backend
- Implement client-side validation with server validation
- Use React Context for auth state management
- Store tokens securely in HttpOnly cookies
- Follow OAuth 2.0 best practices

## Next Steps
1. Set up Supabase project and configure auth settings
2. Implement basic signup and login forms
3. Create authentication context and middleware
4. Test authentication flows end-to-end
