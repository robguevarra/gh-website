# Email System - Phase 3: Transactional Emails

## Task Objective
To design and implement a robust transactional email system that automatically sends timely and relevant emails to users based on specific actions or system events (e.g., user registration, password reset, payment confirmation), enhancing user experience and platform communication.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Existing Infrastructure (Analyzed from Codebase)**

**Database Structure:**
- **`email_templates` table** exists with 10 templates:
  - "Fixed Welcome Email" (category: authentication, subcategory: onboarding)
  - "Fixed Password Reset" (category: system, subcategory: account) 
  - "Fixed Payment Confirmation" (category: system, subcategory: payment)
  - Other marketing templates (newsletters, course announcements, etc.)
  - Table schema: id, name, description, subject, html_content, text_content, variables (jsonb), design (jsonb for Unlayer), category, subcategory, version, active, metadata, tags

**Payment Infrastructure (Working Flows):**
- **Xendit webhook** (`app/api/webhooks/xendit/route.ts`) handles 3 transaction types:
  1. **P2P (Papers to Profits)**: Creates user account ‚Üí enrolls in course ‚Üí tags "P2P Purchase" & "P2P Enrolled"
  2. **Canva**: Stores contact in `ebook_contacts` ‚Üí tags "Canva Purchase" 
  3. **SHOPIFY_ECOM**: Creates order in `ecommerce_orders` ‚Üí grants Google Drive permissions ‚Üí tags appropriately

**Tagging System:**
- Tags table with existing relevant tags: "P2P Purchase", "Canva Purchase", "P2P Enrolled"
- User tagging happens automatically in webhook but **NO EMAIL TRIGGERS**

**User Management:**
- `unified_profiles` table (3,074 users)
- `transactions` table (3,156 records) 
- `enrollments` table (2,709 records)
- `ebook_contacts` table (3 records)

### ‚ùå **Missing Components (Critical Gaps)**

1. **No centralized email sending service** - No `sendTransactionalEmail` function exists anywhere in codebase
2. **No email triggers in webhook** - Business logic completes but doesn't send emails
3. **Supabase Auth email integration** - Unknown how password reset emails are currently handled
4. **Template content customization** - Existing templates are generic, need personalization for each flow
5. **Email delivery for Canva ebook** - No mechanism to send Google Drive links
6. **Multi-item email support** - Shopify orders need to display multiple products
7. **üö® CRITICAL: Lead capture for incomplete purchases** - Users who fill forms but don't complete payment are lost

### **üí° Lead Capture Opportunity (Industry Best Practice)**

**Current Problem:**
- **P2P Flow**: User fills `/papers-to-profits` form ‚Üí redirected to Xendit ‚Üí if payment fails/abandoned, contact info is lost
- **Canva Flow**: User fills `/canva-ebook` form ‚Üí redirected to Xendit ‚Üí if payment fails/abandoned, contact info is lost

**Industry Best Practice Solution:**
1. **Immediate Lead Capture**: Store contact info when form is submitted (BEFORE payment redirect)
2. **Funnel Tracking**: Track user status through payment journey
3. **Abandoned Cart Recovery**: Email sequences to recover incomplete purchases (industry standard 15-25% recovery rate)
4. **Lead Segmentation**: Different email treatment for leads vs paying customers
5. **GDPR Compliance**: Proper consent and data retention policies

**Proposed Lead Statuses:**
- `form_submitted` - Contact filled form, not yet redirected to payment
- `payment_initiated` - Redirected to Xendit payment page
- `payment_completed` - Successfully paid and became customer
- `payment_failed` - Payment attempt failed (retry opportunity)
- `payment_abandoned` - Initiated payment but didn't complete within 24-48 hours
- `lead_nurture` - In email nurture sequence for conversion

## Future State Goal
A fully operational transactional email system where:
- All key transactional emails are automatically triggered by existing business logic flows
- Email templates follow design context branding (Purple #b08ba5, Pink #f1b5bc, Blue #9ac5d9)
- Centralized email service handles template retrieval, variable substitution, and delivery
- Google Drive links are sent for Canva ebook purchases
- All emails are logged and errors handled gracefully

## Implementation Plan

### 1. ‚úÖ Codebase Analysis and Current State Documentation
- [x] **Database Schema Analysis**: Confirmed `email_templates` table structure and existing templates
- [x] **Payment Flow Analysis**: Documented 3 working payment flows in Xendit webhook
- [x] **Tagging System Review**: Confirmed automatic tagging works but lacks email triggers
- [x] **Infrastructure Assessment**: Identified missing centralized email service

### 2. Lead Capture and Funnel Tracking Implementation

#### 2.1 Database Schema Updates
- [ ] **Create Lead Tracking Table** (via Supabase migration):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE purchase_leads (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    product_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'P2P', 'Canva', 'SHOPIFY_ECOM'
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'form_submitted', -- form_submitted, payment_initiated, payment_completed, payment_failed, payment_abandoned, lead_nurture
    amount NUMERIC, -- Intended purchase amount
    currency TEXT DEFAULT 'PHP',
    xendit_external_id TEXT, -- Link to payment attempt
    source_page TEXT, -- e.g., '/papers-to-profits', '/canva-ebook'
    utm_source TEXT,
    utm_medium TEXT,
    utm_campaign TEXT,
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    last_activity_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    converted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    UNIQUE(email, product_type, submitted_at::date) -- Prevent duplicate leads same day
  );
