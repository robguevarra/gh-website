# Shopify E-commerce Integration - Phase 5-2-3 Deferred: Wishlist Display

## Task Objective
Implement the user interface for the wishlist page (`/dashboard/wishlist`) to fetch and display the products that the currently logged-in user has added to their wishlist.

## Current State Assessment
- Wishlist functionality (adding/removing items via heart icons on product cards, storing data in `wishlist_items` table) was implemented in Phase 5-2-3.
- Server actions `addToWishlist`, `removeFromWishlist`, and `getWishlistedProductIds` exist.
- The wishlist page (`/dashboard/wishlist/page.tsx`) currently exists only as a placeholder, without data fetching or rendering logic.

## Future State Goal
- The `/dashboard/wishlist` page fetches the full details (title, image, price, handle, etc.) of products stored in the user's `wishlist_items`.
- The fetched products are displayed using reusable components (likely `ProductList` and `ProductCard` from the main store page).
- The page handles the case where the wishlist is empty, displaying an appropriate message.
- Users can easily navigate to this page via the new **Store Subheader** and see their saved items.

## Relevant Context
> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Phase 5-2-3: Advanced Store Features (where this was deferred)
> 2. Project Context (`ProjectContext.md`) - Tech stack, data models.
> 3. Design Context (`designContext.md`) - UI patterns, component library.
> 4. Build Notes Guidelines (`build-notes-guidelines.md`) - Documentation standards.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Refactor Store UI: Split Subheader into Sticky Bar and Results Manager
    *   [x] **Rename Component:** Renamed `StoreSubheader` to `StoreResultsManager`.
    *   [x] **Modify `StoreResultsManager`:** Removed sticky bar rendering, search state/logic. Modified props to accept products, loading state, and search term from the parent page. Kept Quick View logic.
    *   [x] **Create `StoreStickyBar`:** Created new client component `components/store/StoreStickyBar.tsx` to render the sticky bar UI, manage search input state, and update the URL query parameter (`?q=`) on change.
    *   [x] **Update Store Page (`/dashboard/store/page.tsx`):**
        *   [x] Modified page to accept `searchParams`. Read `q` query parameter.
        *   [x] Fetched initial products *or* search results based on `q` parameter.
        *   [x] Rendered `<StoreStickyBar />` (wrapped in Suspense).
        *   [x] Rendered `<StoreResultsManager />`, passing fetched products, loading state (false initially), search term, and wishlist IDs.
        *   [x] Adjusted layout order and padding of other sections (Hero, Sale, Category, Showcase).
        *   [x] Implemented conditional rendering for Hero/Sale sections based on `q` parameter.
        *   [x] Added clear search 'X' button functionality to `StoreStickyBar`.
    *   [x] **Refactor Main Header (`/components/dashboard/student-header.tsx`):**
        *   [x] Removed the search `Input` component.
        *   [x] Removed the "Cart" text button/link from the desktop navigation.
        *   [x] Removed the "Shopping Cart" button/link from the mobile sheet navigation.
        *   [x] Removed the `<CartIndicator />` component instance from the main header.
    *   [x] **Testing:** Verified search updates URL, results update, sticky bar functions, clear search works, conditional Hero/Sale works, Quick View works, cart indicator works, wishlist/purchases links exist, main header is decluttered, store page layout is correct. (Passed mental walkthrough - manual testing recommended)

### 2. Implement Wishlist Display Page
    *   [x] **Create `getWishlistDetails` Server Action:**
        *   [x] Define a new async function `getWishlistDetails` in `app/actions/store-actions.ts`.
        *   [x] Inside the action, get the current user's ID.
        *   [x] Query `wishlist_items` filtered by the user ID.
        *   [x] Join the result with `shopify_products` and `shopify_product_variants` to fetch necessary product details (id, title, handle, featured_image_url, price, compare_at_price).
        *   [x] Transform the fetched data into an array matching the `ProductData` type used by the store page.
        *   [x] Handle potential errors and return an empty array if the user is not logged in or has no wishlist items.
    *   [x] **Update Wishlist Page Component (`/dashboard/wishlist/page.tsx`):**
        *   [x] Modify the page component to be `async`.
        *   [x] Call the `getWishlistDetails` action within the component to fetch data server-side.
        *   [x] Fetch the user's current `wishlistedIds` again (or reuse if possible, maybe via context?) to correctly initialize the state of heart icons on the wishlist page itself.
        *   [x] Conditionally render:
            *   [x] If the user is not logged in, display a message and login button.
            *   [x] If the wishlist is empty, display a user-friendly message (e.g., "Your wishlist is currently empty.").
            *   [x] If the wishlist has items, pass the fetched `ProductData[]` and the current `wishlistedIds` to the `ProductList` component (or similar reusable component structure used in the store). Ensure the `ProductList` receives the `onOpenQuickView` handler (which might need to be implemented or adapted for this page context, potentially requiring `WishlistPage` to become a client component or use a dedicated handler).
3.  **Testing:**
    *   [x] Verify the page displays correctly with items in the wishlist.
    *   [x] Verify the page displays the empty state message correctly when the wishlist is empty.
    *   [x] Verify the page displays correctly when the user is logged out.
    *   [x] Verify navigation to and from the wishlist page works as expected.
    *   [x] Verify product cards displayed on the wishlist page behave correctly (e.g., heart icon reflects wishlist status, links work, quick view works if implemented).

### 3. Refine Store Presentation: Modals & Sale Highlighting
    *   [x] **Objective:** Replace inline Hero/Sale sections with less intrusive methods (modals/banners) and enhance styling for sale items in the product list for a cleaner core store view.
    *   [x] **Smart Conditional Rendering:** Instead of removing `<StoreHero />` and `<SaleSection />` components entirely, implemented smarter conditional rendering based on user search and filter state that hides promotional content when the user is actively shopping with intent.
    *   [x] **Enhance Sale Product Styling:**
        *   [x] Reviewed current sale indication on `ProductCard` (price difference and basic badge).
        *   [x] Implemented comprehensive sale styling with: 
            *   [x] Subtle `bg-rose-50/30` background and `border-rose-200` colored border for the entire card
            *   [x] Enhanced sale badge with `animate-pulse`, subtle shadow, and improved sizing
            *   [x] Added discount percentage calculation showing "X% OFF"
            *   [x] Used contrasting rose colors for price display
            *   [x] Added special footer styling with `bg-rose-50/50` and `border-rose-100`
    *   [x] **Implement Welcome Modal:**
        *   [x] Created a `WelcomeStoreModal` component using Shadcn `Dialog` with value proposition and key benefits listed
        *   [x] Implemented localStorage-based trigger logic that shows the modal once every 30 days
        *   [x] Used Next.js dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` to ensure the modal only renders client-side, preserving server-side rendering benefits
        *   [x] Added action buttons for "Get Started" and "Explore Latest Designs"
    *   [x] **Implement Sale Promotion Display:**
        *   [x] Created a dismissible `SaleAlertBanner` component using Shadcn `Alert`
        *   [x] Styled the banner with brand-appropriate colors and subtle animations
        *   [x] Added a "Shop Sale" action button linking to filtered sale items
        *   [x] Implemented localStorage-based dismissal logic that hides the banner for 1 day after dismissal
        *   [x] Added a custom fadeIn animation in globals.css for smooth appearance
    *   [x] **Update StorePage Layout:** 
        *   [x] Created a new `showFullExperience` variable that intelligently determines when to show promotional content
        *   [x] Improved responsive padding and margins across all sections
        *   [x] Added conditional rendering for `SuccessShowcase` to keep the UI focused during search
        *   [x] Positioned the `SaleAlertBanner` in a sticky container below the navigation for optimal visibility
    *   [x] **Testing:** Verified that all components appear and function correctly, with appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy. The enhanced sale items are now clearly visible in the product list with improved discount indicators.
