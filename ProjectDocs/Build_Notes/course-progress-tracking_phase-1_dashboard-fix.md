# Course Progress Tracking System: Phase 1 - Dashboard Fix

## Task Objective
Fix the course progress display on the dashboard to accurately reflect the user's completed lessons.

## Current State Assessment
- The dashboard's CourseProgressSection component was showing 0 completed lessons even when lessons were completed.
- The database was calculating course progress based on completed modules rather than completed lessons.
- The progress data wasn't being properly passed from the store to the UI components.
- Console logs showed: `CourseProgressSection received progress data: {progress: 0, completedLessons: 0, totalLessons: 0, courseId: ''}`

## Future State Goal
- The dashboard accurately displays the correct number of completed lessons and total lessons.
- The progress percentage is calculated correctly based on completed lessons.
- The database triggers properly update course progress when lessons are completed.
- All components display consistent progress information.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fix the Student Dashboard Store ✓
- [x] Enhanced the `loadUserProgress` function to properly calculate and log course progress.
- [x] Added verification against database values to ensure consistency.
- [x] Added detailed logging to help diagnose progress calculation issues.

### Step 2: Improve the CourseProgressSection Component ✓
- [x] Enhanced the database verification logic to fetch and count total lessons.
- [x] Added proper fallback logic when progress data is incomplete.
- [x] Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.

### Step 3: Update the Dashboard Page ✓
- [x] Added additional debugging to track course progress after loading.
- [x] Ensured proper refresh of progress data on dashboard visits.

### Step 4: Fix Database Triggers ✓
- [x] Created a migration to update the `update_course_progress` function.
- [x] Modified the trigger to calculate progress based on lessons, not modules.
- [x] Added a direct trigger from user_progress to course_progress for immediate updates.
- [x] Fixed existing data for current users.

## Technical Details

### Database Trigger Improvements
The original trigger was calculating course progress based on completed modules, which didn't accurately reflect the user's progress through individual lessons. The updated trigger now:

1. Counts total lessons in the course
2. Counts completed lessons for the user
3. Calculates progress as `(completed_lessons / total_lessons) * 100`
4. Updates the course_progress table with the correct percentage

Additionally, we added a direct trigger from user_progress to course_progress, so that course progress is updated immediately when a lesson is completed, without requiring a module_progress update first.

### Component Enhancements
The CourseProgressSection component now has improved verification logic:

1. If it receives 0 completed lessons but there are completed lessons in the store, it verifies with the database
2. It fetches the course structure to count total lessons
3. It updates the UI with the correct counts and percentages

### Store Optimizations
The student dashboard store now:

1. Logs calculated progress for debugging
2. Verifies calculated progress against database values
3. Provides more detailed information about progress calculations

## Testing and Validation
- Verified that the dashboard now shows the correct progress (57.14% for the test user)
- Confirmed that the database trigger correctly updates course progress
- Tested that marking lessons as complete updates the progress immediately
- Verified that the UI components display consistent progress information

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a background job to periodically sync progress data for all users
- Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Implement progress caching for better performance
- Add analytics to track user progress over time
