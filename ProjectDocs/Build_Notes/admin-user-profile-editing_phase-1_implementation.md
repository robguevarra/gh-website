# Admin User Profile Editing - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Enhance the personal details tab with comprehensive user profile information and implement editable fields with validation.

## Current State Assessment
The current user profile form has basic fields (first name, last name, email, phone, role) but lacks comprehensive user information, validation, and confirmation workflows for sensitive changes.

## Future State Goal
A robust user profile editing system with comprehensive fields, client-side validation, server-side validation, confirmation workflows for sensitive changes, optimistic updates, and proper audit logging.

## Implementation Plan

1. ✓ Enhance UserProfileForm with additional fields
   - ✓ Add avatar URL field
   - ✓ Add account status field
   - ✓ Add verified account checkbox
   - ✓ Add acquisition source field
   - ✓ Add tags field
   - ✓ Add admin notes field
   - ✓ Organize fields into logical sections

2. ✓ Improve validation and error handling
   - ✓ Enhance client-side validation with Zod
   - ✓ Add server-side validation in the updateUserProfile server action
   - ✓ Implement proper error handling and user feedback
   - ✓ Add form reset functionality

3. ✓ Add confirmation workflows for sensitive changes
   - ✓ Create reusable UserConfirmationDialog component
   - ✓ Implement confirmation for role changes
   - ✓ Implement confirmation for status changes
   - ✓ Add visual indicators for fields that will be changed

4. ✓ Implement optimistic updates for better UX
   - ✓ Show success message immediately after form submission
   - ✓ Refresh the page to show updated data
   - ✓ Add loading indicators during form submission

5. ✓ Ensure all edits are properly logged
   - ✓ Enhance updateUserProfile server action with detailed audit logging
   - ✓ Track sensitive changes separately for enhanced logging
   - ✓ Include request metadata in audit logs

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Form Structure
The form is now organized into logical sections:
- Personal Information (name, email, phone, avatar)
- Account Settings (role, status, verification)
- Marketing & Analytics (acquisition source, tags)
- Admin Notes (internal notes visible only to administrators)

### Validation Strategy
- Client-side validation using Zod schema
- Server-side validation in the updateUserProfile server action
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Confirmation Workflow
- Sensitive changes (role, status) trigger a confirmation dialog
- Visual indicators show which fields will be changed
- Confirmation dialog shows the old and new values

### Audit Logging
- All changes are logged to the admin_audit_log table
- Detailed metadata includes:
  - Changes made (field, old value, new value)
  - Sensitive changes highlighted
  - Request metadata (IP address, user agent)

## Testing
- Tested form validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Verified server actions correctly update the database
- Tested audit logging for all edit operations
- Ensured error messages are clear and helpful

## Future Improvements
- Add image upload functionality for avatars
- Implement more sophisticated tag management
- Add user activity timeline
- Implement more granular permission controls
- Add multi-factor authentication management
