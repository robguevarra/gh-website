# Email System Phase 2: Advanced Features & User Management

## Task Objective
Build out advanced email capabilities for the Graceful Homeschooling platform by implementing user segmentation, campaign management, comprehensive webhook processing, analytics dashboard, and user preference management systems.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, the platform has a functional email infrastructure with Postmark integration and Unlayer email template editing capabilities. The core email template management system is implemented and working well, allowing administrators to create, edit, and test email templates with a user-friendly interface. However, we lack advanced features such as user segmentation, campaign management, comprehensive analytics, and user preference controls.

## Future State Goal
A robust, feature-complete email marketing and transactional system that enables:
- Fine-grained user segmentation based on tags, behaviors, and attributes
- Comprehensive campaign creation, scheduling, and automation
- Real-time email analytics with detailed reporting and visualization
- Full user preference management with compliance features
- Webhook processing for comprehensive event tracking

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed email system Phase 1 implementation
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Email template manager documentation
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Previously Completed Email System Phase 1
- Postmark account is set up and configured
- Unlayer editor is fully integrated with template management
- Basic template creation, editing, and testing functionality is working
- Initial set of email templates has been created
- Basic sending functionality is implemented

### From Email Template Manager Documentation
- Email templates are stored in Supabase with version history
- Proper variable system is implemented for template personalization
- Templates are organized by categories and subcategories
- Test sending functionality is implemented

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Webhook Processing Infrastructure
- [x] Design secure webhook endpoint architecture
  - Created authenticated REST endpoint to receive Postmark events (`/api/webhooks/postmark`).
  - Implemented request validation and robust error handling/logging.
  - Designed for idempotency using event IDs and deduplication (via message ID and record type).
- [x] Develop event normalization and storage system
  - Implemented adapter pattern for Postmark event types.
  - Created unified schema for email events in Supabase (`postmark_events` table).
  - Storage is efficient and indexed by event type and timestamp.
- [ ] Create real-time processing pipeline
  - Develop stream processing for webhook events
  - Implement event aggregation and metric calculation
  - Add real-time updates to analytics dashboards
  - Include alerting for anomalies (high bounce rates, etc.)

### 2. User Tagging and Segmentation System
- [ ] Design and implement user tagging data model
  - Create flexible schema for hierarchical tags
  - Add support for tag metadata
  - Implement efficient querying mechanisms
- [ ] Build user segmentation engine
  - Develop query builder with complex logical operations
  - Implement caching for frequently used segments
  - Create extensible system for new segmentation criteria
- [ ] Create user segmentation UI components
  - Build intuitive interface for tag management
  - Implement segment creation with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Add segment preview with audience size estimation
  - Create segment saving and sharing capabilities

### 3. Campaign Management System
- [ ] Design campaign data model and architecture
  - Create models for campaigns, templates, content versions
  - Implement scheduling and approval workflows
  - Add audit logging for all changes
- [ ] Develop campaign creation and editing workflow
  - Build draft/publish workflow
  - Implement version control for campaign content
  - Create template selection and personalization options
  - Add content validation and preview functionality
- [ ] Implement campaign scheduling and delivery system
  - Build scheduling with timezone support
  - Add recurring campaign capabilities
  - Implement delivery throttling and batch processing
  - Create monitoring for delivery progress
- [ ] Build campaign targeting functionality
  - Integrate segmentation engine with campaign system
  - Implement recipient preview with pagination
  - Add delivery metrics and audience size validation

### 4. Email Analytics System
- [ ] Design email analytics data warehouse
  - Create dimensional model for email analytics
  - Implement ETL processes for data aggregation
  - Optimize for analytical queries
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard UI
  - Implement dashboard with real-time and historical views
  - Create drill-down capabilities
  - Add customizable date ranges and filters
  - Create exportable reports
  - Implement visualizations for key metrics (opens, clicks, etc.)

### 5. User Preference Management
- [ ] Design user preference data model
  - Create schema for granular preference management
  - Implement audit logging for preference changes
  - Add proper validation for preference updates
- [ ] Develop user preference management UI
  - Build intuitive preference center interface
  - Implement one-click unsubscribe functionality
  - Create confirmation workflows for preference changes
  - Ensure mobile-friendly design
- [ ] Implement ESP preference synchronization
  - Develop bidirectional sync with Postmark
  - Handle webhook-initiated preference changes
  - Add retry logic and conflict resolution

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- All webhook endpoints must implement signature verification
- Preference management must include proper authentication
- Campaign targeting should respect user privacy settings
- Analytics system must anonymize data where appropriate

### Performance
- Event processing must scale to handle high volumes
- Segmentation queries should optimize for performance
- Analytics data should leverage appropriate indexes
- Campaign delivery should implement queueing and throttling

### Compliance
- Implement unsubscribe tracking and enforcement
- Maintain audit logs for all preference changes
- Ensure all marketing emails include required compliance elements
- Support data retention policies

### User Experience
- Admin interfaces should provide clear feedback
- Analytics should be intuitive and actionable
- Campaign creation should include validation and previews
- Preference management should be simple and clear for end users

## Completion Status

This phase is currently pending implementation.

## Next Steps After Completion

After establishing the advanced email features in Phase 2, we will move on to Phase 3: Optimize, Finalize, and Document. This will include performance optimizations, comprehensive testing, user training, and documentation.
