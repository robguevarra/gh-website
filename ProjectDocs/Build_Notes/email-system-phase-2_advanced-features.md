# Email System Phase 2: Advanced Features & User Management

## Task Objective
Build out advanced email capabilities for the Graceful Homeschooling platform by implementing user segmentation, campaign management, comprehensive webhook processing, analytics dashboard, and user preference management systems.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, the platform has a functional email infrastructure with Postmark integration and Unlayer email template editing capabilities. The core email template management system is implemented and working well, allowing administrators to create, edit, and test email templates with a user-friendly interface. However, we lack advanced features such as user segmentation, campaign management, comprehensive analytics, and user preference controls.

## Future State Goal
A robust, feature-complete email marketing and transactional system that enables:
- Fine-grained user segmentation based on tags, behaviors, and attributes
- Comprehensive campaign creation, scheduling, and automation
- Real-time email analytics with detailed reporting and visualization
- Full user preference management with compliance features
- Webhook processing for comprehensive event tracking

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed email system Phase 1 implementation
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Email template manager documentation
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Previously Completed Email System Phase 1
- Postmark account is set up and configured
- Unlayer editor is fully integrated with template management
- Basic template creation, editing, and testing functionality is working
- Initial set of email templates has been created
- Basic sending functionality is implemented

### From Email Template Manager Documentation
- Email templates are stored in Supabase with version history
- Proper variable system is implemented for template personalization
- Templates are organized by categories and subcategories
- Test sending functionality is implemented

## Implementation Plan

> **Status Note (2025-05-11):**
> - Webhook endpoint architecture and event normalization/storage are complete and in production.
> - Advanced analytics API and documentation are implemented (see `/api/email/analytics`).
> - Dashboard analytics integration is now split into two parallel efforts:
>   1. **Admin Dashboard Email Analytics:** ~~Create a new section in the admin dashboard dedicated to email analytics~~
>   - ~~Fetch data from `/api/email/analytics` endpoint~~
>   - ~~Display metric cards showing key email performance indicators~~
>   - ~~Implement trend charts to visualize email metrics over time~~
>   - ~~Add a table showing top email bounces and delivery issues~~
>   **Completed:**
>   - Platform-wide Email Analytics dashboard tab is now live in the admin dashboard.
>   - Features: metric cards, trend chart (Recharts), date/event filters, and top bounces table.
>   - Built as a modular Next.js client component with Shadcn UI, mobile-first, and DRY principles.
>   - Data is fetched from `/api/email/analytics` using client-side hooks for a responsive UX.
>   2. **Per-User Email Event Stats:** ~~Implement per-user email event history and engagement stats (API + UI) in the user detail view (`/api/admin/users/[id]/email-events`)~~

   **Completed:**
   - Per-user email analytics tab is now live in the admin user detail view.
   - API endpoint: `/api/admin/users/[id]/email-events` returns all user-specific email events with filtering.
   - UI: Metric cards, filters, and event table are implemented using modular, mobile-first components.
   - Data is fetched client-side for a responsive admin experience.

> - Redundant tasks have been cleaned up in Task Master. See tasks.json for the authoritative list.
> - Remaining work (in progress): real-time processing, user tagging/segmentation, campaign management, and analytics dashboard UI.
> - This phase is actively underway. See tasks.json for subtask status.

### 1. Webhook Processing Infrastructure

#### Completion Summary (Per-User Email Analytics)
- The per-user email analytics feature is fully implemented and integrated into the admin user detail view.
- All work is traceable to Task Master task #39 and related subtasks.
- This completes the analytics requirements for both platform-wide and per-user scopes.

- [x] Design secure webhook endpoint architecture
  - Created authenticated REST endpoint to receive Postmark events (`/api/webhooks/postmark`).
  - Implemented request validation and robust error handling/logging.
  - Designed for idempotency using event IDs and deduplication (via message ID and record type).
- [x] Develop event normalization and storage system
  - Implemented adapter pattern for Postmark event types.
  - Created unified schema for email events in Supabase (`postmark_events` table).
  - Storage is efficient and indexed by event type and timestamp.
- [x] Create real-time processing pipeline
  - Implemented a Postgres trigger on postmark_events for real-time normalization into email_events
  - Added payload JSONB column to email_events for full event context
  - All new webhook events are now processed and available for analytics instantly
  - ETL script retained for backfill and legacy events
  - Includes idempotency, error handling, and industry-standard event warehousing patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- All webhook endpoints must implement signature verification
- Preference management must include proper authentication
- Campaign targeting should respect user privacy settings
- Analytics system must anonymize data where appropriate

### Performance
- Event processing must scale to handle high volumes
- Segmentation queries should optimize for performance
- Analytics data should leverage appropriate indexes
- Campaign delivery should implement queueing and throttling

### Compliance
- Implement unsubscribe tracking and enforcement
- Maintain audit logs for all preference changes
- Ensure all marketing emails include required compliance elements
- Support data retention policies

### User Experience
- Admin interfaces should provide clear feedback
- Analytics should be intuitive and actionable
- Campaign creation should include validation and previews
- Preference management should be simple and clear for end users

## Completion Status

This phase is currently pending implementation.

## Next Steps After Completion

After establishing the advanced email features in Phase 2, we will move on to Phase 3: Optimize, Finalize, and Document. This will include performance optimizations, comprehensive testing, user training, and documentation.
