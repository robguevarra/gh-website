# Pillow Talk Sales Implementation - Phase 1: Public Sale Transaction System

## Task Objective
Implement a robust `PUBLIC_SALE` transaction system for the Pillow Talk commercial license sale and future public products, extending the existing payment infrastructure without disrupting production systems. This will enable automated product delivery via email templates while maintaining the flexibility to support multiple future public sale products.

## Current State Assessment
The platform currently has a functioning Xendit payment webhook system that handles multiple transaction types (`P2P`, `SHOPIFY_ECOM`, `Canva`) with specific email delivery logic. Each transaction type has dedicated handling in the webhook processor, and the Canva ebook system serves as the perfect template for our implementation. The Pillow Talk email template "Pillow Talk License Delivery" already exists in the database with the Google Drive link embedded.

## Future State Goal
A complete public sale system that:
- Uses the existing webhook infrastructure with a new `PUBLIC_SALE` transaction type
- Automatically delivers product emails based on configurable product mappings
- Supports multiple public sale products through a generic, reusable system
- Maintains the simplicity of the Canva ebook approach while being scalable
- Requires minimal changes to the existing production webhook code

## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes (Pillow Talk Landing Page implementation)
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our payment approach:
- **Payment Processing**: Xendit integration for invoice creation and webhook handling
- **Email Delivery**: Transactional email service with template-based delivery
- **Database Structure**: Existing transactions table with transaction_type field

### From Previously Completed Phases
The project has already completed:
- **Pillow Talk Landing Page**: Comprehensive landing page with countdown timer and order form at `/specialsale`
- **Email Template**: "Pillow Talk License Delivery" template created with embedded Google Drive link
- **Payment Infrastructure**: Xendit webhook system handling multiple transaction types

### From Existing Canva Implementation
The Canva ebook transaction handling provides the exact pattern to follow:
- Transaction type: `"Canva"` 
- Email template: `"Canva Ebook Delivery"`
- Google Drive link: Embedded in email template
- Contact storage: Optional, stores buyer information
- Lead status update: Updates purchase_leads if leadId exists
- User tagging: Applies product-specific tags

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Preparation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `public_sale_orders` table for order tracking
  - `id` (UUID primary key)
  - `transaction_id` (UUID references transactions.id UNIQUE)
  - `product_code` (e.g., 'pillow_talk')
  - `product_name` (display name)
  - `customer_email`, `customer_name`, `customer_phone`
  - `original_price`, `sale_price`
  - `delivery_method`, `drive_link`, `delivered_at`
  - `utm_source`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_medium`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`
- [x] Add proper indexes and constraints
- [x] Test table creation and relationships

### 2. Create New Payment Action (Zero Impact on Existing) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `app/actions/public-sale-actions.ts` (NEW FILE)
  - Implement `createPublicSalePaymentIntent()` function
  - Copy Canva ebook payment logic exactly (proven approach)
  - Use `transaction_type: 'PUBLIC_SALE'`
  - Include product metadata
- [x] Test payment intent creation independently

### 3. Create New Webhook Handler (Completely Isolated) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `lib/webhooks/public-sale-handler.ts` (NEW FILE)
  - Implement `handlePublicSaleTransaction()` function
  - Copy Canva ebook email delivery logic exactly
  - Handle product configuration via metadata
  - Include contact storage and lead updates
- [x] Test handler function independently

### 4. Minimal Webhook Integration (One Line Addition) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add ONE `else if` branch to existing webhook `/api/webhooks/xendit/route.ts`
  - `else if (tx.transaction_type === "PUBLIC_SALE") { await handlePublicSaleTransaction(tx, supabase); }`
  - Zero modification to existing transaction logic
  - All new logic contained in separate handler
- [x] Test new branch without affecting existing flows

### 5. Email Template Verification ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Verify existing "Pillow Talk License Delivery" template
  - Confirm Google Drive link is correctly embedded
  - Ensure template variables align with webhook data
  - Test template rendering with sample data

### 6. Landing Page Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Update `/specialsale` page to use new payment action
  - Import and use `createPublicSalePaymentIntent()`
  - Include `product_code: 'pillow_talk'` in metadata
  - Test form submission and payment flow

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] End-to-end testing with test payments
- [ ] Verify existing transaction types still work (P2P, Canva, Shopify)
- [ ] Test error handling and rollback scenarios
- [ ] Verify email delivery using actual template
- [ ] Performance testing

## Technical Considerations

### Minimal Risk Architecture
- **New Files Only**: Create separate payment action and webhook handler files
- **One Line Addition**: Only add a single `else if` branch to existing webhook
- **Zero Modification**: Existing transaction types remain completely untouched
- **Independent Testing**: New logic can be tested without affecting production

### Database Design
- `public_sale_orders` table tracks individual orders with full customer and product details
- Links to existing `transactions` table via foreign key relationship
- Includes UTM tracking for marketing analytics
- Supports multiple delivery methods and tracking of delivery status

### Webhook Processing Strategy
- **Isolation**: All new logic contained in `handlePublicSaleTransaction()` function
- **Copy Pattern**: Exact replication of proven Canva ebook logic
- **Metadata-Driven**: Product configuration passed via transaction metadata
- **Error Boundaries**: New handler errors don't affect existing transaction processing

### Email Delivery Approach
- Use existing "Pillow Talk License Delivery" template (already created)
- Google Drive link embedded directly in template (no dynamic links needed)
- Follow exact same email sending pattern as Canva ebook implementation
- Support for contact storage and lead status updates

### File Structure
```
app/actions/
├── payment-actions.ts (EXISTING - UNTOUCHED)
└── public-sale-actions.ts (NEW)

app/api/webhooks/xendit/
└── route.ts (EXISTING - ONE LINE ADDED)

lib/webhooks/
└── public-sale-handler.ts (NEW)
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback**: Comment out single line in webhook to disable
- **Monitoring**: Dedicated logging for public sale transactions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Errors in new handler don't break existing flows
- **Production Safety**: Existing revenue streams completely protected

## Completion Status ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

This phase has been **successfully implemented** using the minimal-risk approach:
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing webhook infrastructure (only 4 lines added)
- ✅ Copy-paste approach from proven Canva implementation
- ✅ Database-driven configuration for scalability
- ✅ All core functionality implemented and ready for testing

**Successfully Implemented:**
- ✅ Database schema creation (`public_sale_orders` table with indexes)
- ✅ New payment action (`app/actions/public-sale-actions.ts`)
- ✅ Isolated webhook handler (`lib/webhooks/public-sale-handler.ts`)
- ✅ Minimal webhook integration (single `else if` branch)
- ✅ Landing page integration (`/specialsale` now uses PUBLIC_SALE)
- ✅ Email template verification ("Pillow Talk License Delivery" confirmed)
- ✅ Product tagging system ("Pillow Talk Purchase" tag created)

**Risk Mitigation Achieved:**
- Zero modification to existing transaction logic (P2P, Canva, Shopify untouched)
- All new logic contained in separate files
- Rollback capability: comment out 4 lines in webhook
- Production safety: existing revenue streams completely protected

**Ready for Testing:**
- End-to-end payment flow using test Xendit invoices
- Email delivery verification

**Environment Variable Required:**
- `PILLOW_TALK_DRIVE_LINK`: Google Drive link for the Pillow Talk commercial license files

**Testing Recommendations:**
1. **Test the new PUBLIC_SALE flow** using the `/specialsale` page
2. **Verify existing flows still work** (try a P2P purchase and Canva ebook)
3. **Check email delivery** using the "Pillow Talk License Delivery" template
4. **Validate database records** in `public_sale_orders` table
5. **Confirm user tagging** with "Pillow Talk Purchase" tag
