# Admin User Management System - Layout and Navigation

## Task Objective
Create a responsive, accessible admin interface layout with navigation structure and authentication guards for the admin user management system.

## Current State Assessment

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- `/app/admin/layout.tsx`: Admin layout component
- `/app/admin/page.tsx`: Admin dashboard page
- `/app/admin/users/page.tsx`: User management list page
- `/app/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx`: User detail page
- `/components/admin/sidebar.tsx`: Navigation sidebar component
- `/components/admin/breadcrumb.tsx`: Breadcrumb navigation component
- `/middleware.ts`: Authentication middleware
- `/lib/auth.ts`: Authentication utilities

### Key Components to Implement
1. **Admin Layout**
   - Main layout with sidebar and content area
   - Responsive design with mobile toggle
   - Error boundary for admin components

2. **Navigation Sidebar**
   - Collapsible navigation sections
   - Active state highlighting
   - User role-based menu items

3. **User Management Components**
   - User search and filter form
   - User list with pagination
   - User detail view with tabs

4. **Authentication Components**
   - Admin role verification
   - Access denied page
   - Login redirect for unauthenticated users

### Security Considerations
- All admin routes must be protected by authentication middleware
- Role-based access control for different admin functions
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- CSRF protection for all form submissions
