# Admin Tools and Access Management - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement comprehensive administrative tools including password reset, account status management, and access controls with proper security, confirmation workflows, and audit logging.

## Current State Assessment
The admin user system currently has basic user profile editing capabilities but lacks specialized administrative tools for password management, account status control, and feature access management. There is no dedicated UI for these administrative functions, and the server actions for these operations are not yet implemented.

## Future State Goal
A robust administrative tools interface with secure server actions for password reset, account status management, and feature access controls. All actions will have appropriate confirmation workflows, detailed audit logging, and email notifications for relevant operations.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create Administrative Tools Tab
   - [x] Design and implement the Admin Tools tab in the user detail view
   - [x] Create a tab layout with sections for different administrative functions
   - [x] Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
   - [x] Add appropriate icons and visual cues for different actions

2. Implement Password Reset Functionality
   - [x] Create password reset form with confirmation workflow
   - [x] Implement server action for secure password reset
   - [x] Add email notification for password reset
   - [x] Implement audit logging for password reset actions
   - [x] Add success/error handling and user feedback

3. Implement Account Status Management
   - [x] Create account status management interface
   - [x] Implement status change confirmation dialog
   - [x] Create server action for status changes
   - [x] Add audit logging for status change actions
   - [x] Implement email notifications for status changes

4. Implement Feature Access Management
   - [x] Design feature access control interface
   - [x] Create permission management component
   - [x] Implement server action for updating user permissions
   - [x] Add audit logging for permission changes
   - [x] Add success/error handling and user feedback

5. Enhance Security and Validation
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations
   - [ ] Add additional validation for administrative actions
   - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for all operations
   - [ ] Implement session validation for all admin actions

6. Testing and Documentation
   - [ ] Test all administrative functions thoroughly
   - [ ] Verify audit logging for all actions
   - [ ] Test email notifications
   - [ ] Document all administrative tools and their usage

## Technical Details

### Administrative Tools Tab Structure
The Administrative Tools tab will be organized into the following sections:
- Account Management (status changes, account deletion)
- Security (password reset, MFA management)
- Permissions (feature access controls)
- Communication (email preferences, notification settings)

### Server Actions
We will implement the following server actions:
- `resetUserPassword`: Securely reset a user's password
- `updateUserStatus`: Change a user's account status
- `updateUserPermissions`: Modify a user's feature access permissions
- `sendAdminNotification`: Send administrative notifications to users

### Audit Logging
All administrative actions will be logged to the `admin_audit_log` table with detailed information:
- Action type (password reset, status change, permission update)
- User ID of the administrator performing the action
- User ID of the affected user
- Timestamp
- IP address
- Changes made (before/after values)
- Additional notes or reasons for the action

### Email Notifications
Email notifications will be sent for the following actions:
- Password reset
- Account status changes
- Permission changes

## Dependencies
- Supabase Auth for password management
- Email service for notifications
- Admin audit logging system
