# Performance Optimization - Phase 1: Core Optimizations

## Task Objective
Optimize the Graceful Homeschooling website for better performance, focusing on core web vitals and user experience.

## Current State Assessment
The website is functional but has performance issues that need to be addressed. The current implementation doesn't follow all performance best practices, leading to slower load times and potentially poor user experience.

## Future State Goal
A highly optimized website with excellent performance metrics (90+ Lighthouse scores), fast load times, and smooth user experience across all devices.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Next.js Configuration Optimizations
- [x] Enable SWC minification
- [x] Configure console removal in production
- [x] Enable CSS optimization
- [x] Configure package imports optimization for large libraries
- [x] Disable legacy browser support for modern JavaScript features

### 2. Critical CSS Implementation
- [x] Separate critical CSS from non-critical CSS
- [x] Implement critical CSS in layout.tsx
- [x] Ensure above-the-fold content loads quickly

### 3. Image Optimization
- [x] Create OptimizedImage component with lazy loading
- [x] Implement blur-up technique for image loading
- [x] Use Intersection Observer for better lazy loading

### 4. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports
- [x] Create DynamicImport component for lazy loading
- [x] Implement createDynamicComponent utility
- [x] Document usage patterns for the team

### 5. Resource Hints
- [x] Add preconnect for external domains
- [x] Add dns-prefetch for performance improvement
- [x] Configure proper viewport meta tag

### 6. Font Optimization
- [x] Configure font display swap for better loading
- [x] Optimize Google Fonts loading

### 7. Script Optimization
- [x] Create directory for non-critical scripts
- [x] Implement lazy loading for analytics
- [x] Use Next.js Script component with proper strategy

### 8. Future Optimizations (Phase 2)
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline support
- [ ] Add HTTP/2 Server Push for critical assets
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement responsive image srcsets
- [ ] Add WebP/AVIF image format support

## Performance Metrics Tracking
We're tracking the following metrics:
- Lighthouse Performance Score
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

## Notes
- All optimizations should be tested on both desktop and mobile devices
- Performance should be monitored over time to ensure continued optimization
- New features should follow these optimization patterns
