# Unlayer Email Editor Integration - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Integrate Unlayer's react-email-editor to provide a professional, drag-and-drop email template editing experience for Graceful Homeschooling's admin interface, replacing the current custom TipTap-based solution.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, we use a custom TipTap editor for email templates, which has several limitations:
- Not truly WYSIWYG - editors can't see exactly how emails will render
- Limited email-specific components
- Requires HTML knowledge to create effective templates
- No proper preview functionality across email clients
- Saving and previewing templates is error-prone
- Poor user experience for non-technical admin users

## Future State Goal
A fully functional, user-friendly email template editor with:
- Drag-and-drop interface that's accessible to non-technical users
- Rich component library with email-optimized elements
- Real-time preview across different devices and email clients
- Seamless template saving, loading, and version control
- Support for personalization with merge tags
- Professional, responsive email templates that render correctly in all major email clients

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup and Installation
- [x] Install react-email-editor package
- [x] Create UnlayerEmailEditor wrapper component with proper TypeScript support
- [x] Set up initial configuration options with proper error handling
- [x] Develop theming to match Graceful Homeschooling's branding with proper font configuration

### 2. API and Storage Enhancement
- [x] Update API route to store both HTML and design JSON
- [x] Add database schema changes for design storage with JSONB field
- [x] Implement improved version control with design JSON storage in version history
- [x] Optimize template retrieval for Unlayer with proper typings

### 3. Integration with Current System
- [x] Connect editor to existing template categories and taxonomy system
- [x] Implement template loading and saving with design JSON support
  - [x] **FIXED**: Resolved critical issue with saving templates by implementing direct save function that bypasses React state timing issues
  - [x] Added proper change detection to ensure template modifications are correctly recognized and saved
- [x] ~Create migration process for existing templates~ (DECISION: Create new templates instead of migrating existing ones)
- [x] Add personalization variables as merge tags with proper grouping

### 4. User Interface Enhancements
- [x] Integrated Unlayer interface with EmailTemplatesManager component
- [x] Added preview capabilities with template variables
- [x] Created proper save/edit/revert workflow with version history support

### 5. Testing and Launch
- [ ] Test templates created with Unlayer across major email clients
- [ ] Create several standard template designs for common use cases
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing with admin users
- [ ] Launch to production with documentation for content team

## Remaining Tasks

1. Test templates in various email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
2. Train admin users on the new editor capabilities
3. Document the new template creation process for the content team

**Note**: The following tasks have been completed:
- Created well-designed template types (Newsletter, Announcement, Marketing campaign, Course enrollment)
- Added template management features (Delete, Rename, Duplicate)
