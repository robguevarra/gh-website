# Course Editor Enhancement Phase 2: Kajabi-like Features

## Task Objective
Enhance the course editor with Kajabi-like features, focusing on improved module tree management, content editing, and real-time updates.

## Current State Assessment
- Course editor has multiple drag-and-drop implementations causing conflicts
- Module tree doesn't refresh properly when content is updated
- Toast notifications are inconsistent across the application
- Autosave functionality needs improvement

## Future State Goal
- Single, robust drag-and-drop implementation using @dnd-kit/core
- Real-time module tree updates
- Consistent toast notifications using Sonner
- Improved autosave with proper feedback

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Module Tree Refactor ✅
- [x] Create new ModuleTreeV2 component using @dnd-kit/core
- [x] Implement proper drag constraints and visual feedback
- [x] Add error handling and loading states
- [x] Integrate with course store for state management
- [x] Add refresh functionality through refs

### 2. Content Editor Enhancement ✅
- [x] Create reusable Editor component with TipTap
- [x] Add toolbar with basic formatting options
- [x] Implement autosave with proper debouncing
- [x] Add visual feedback for saving states

### 3. State Management Improvements ✅
- [x] Update course store with module/lesson selection
- [x] Add proper TypeScript types for all entities
- [x] Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- [x] Add proper error handling and recovery

### 4. Testing and Cleanup
- [ ] Test module reordering with different scenarios
- [ ] Test content editing and autosave
- [ ] Remove old module tree implementation
- [ ] Update documentation

## Notes
- Successfully migrated to @dnd-kit/core for better drag-and-drop
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Improved TypeScript types for better type safety
- Next step is to test thoroughly before removing old implementation
