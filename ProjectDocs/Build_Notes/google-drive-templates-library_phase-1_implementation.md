# Google Drive Templates Library Integration - Phase 1 Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a comprehensive Google Drive-based templates library for the dashboard's free templates section, replacing the current mock data implementation with a dynamic file browsing system.

## Current State Assessment
- Templates section currently uses mock data defined in the dashboard page
- Template previews are handled through a basic modal component
- No direct integration with Google Drive for file browsing
- Template data is stored in the database but not efficiently connected to actual files

## Future State Goal
- Direct integration with Google Drive for template browsing and preview
- Seamless file preview and download mechanism
- Real-time file browsing with filtering and search capabilities
- Clean, user-friendly interface that maintains the current design patterns
- Environment-aware implementation that supports both development and production

## Implementation Plan

1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**
   - [x] Create Google Drive API integration hook (`useGoogleDriveFiles`)
   - [x] Implement Google Drive API route for fetching files
   - [x] Define GoogleDriveFile interface for type safety
   - [x] Add environment variable support for Google Drive folder ID and API token

2. **Component Updates**
   - [x] Update TemplateBrowser component to use Google Drive files
   - [x] Refactor TemplatesLibrarySection to support Google Drive integration
   - [x] Update TemplatePreviewModal to work with GoogleDriveFile objects
   - [x] Create GoogleDriveViewer component for file previews

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - [x] Update dashboard page to use GoogleDriveFile objects
   - [x] Replace template mock data with dynamic Google Drive integration
   - [x] Implement file preview and download functionality
   - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

4. **API and Data Layer Updates**
   - [x] Add deprecation notices to existing template-related hooks
   - [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility
   - [x] Create mock data support for development environments

5. **Testing and Refinement**
   - [ ] Test file browsing functionality across different environments
   - [ ] Verify file preview works for various file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)
   - [ ] Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices
   - [ ] Validate error handling for missing files or API issues

6. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - [x] Create Build Notes documenting the implementation
   - [ ] Update project context with Google Drive integration details
   - [ ] Document required environment variables
   - [ ] Clean up any remaining mock data or deprecated code

## Technical Implementation Details

### Environment Variables
```
GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your-folder-id
GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_TOKEN=your-google-drive-api-token
```

### Key Components
1. `lib/hooks/use-google-drive.ts` - Hook for fetching and managing Google Drive files
2. `app/api/google-drive/route.ts` - API route for Google Drive integration
3. `components/dashboard/google-drive-viewer.tsx` - Component for previewing Google Drive files
4. `components/dashboard/template-browser.tsx` - Updated component for browsing templates
5. `components/dashboard/templates-library-section.tsx` - Dashboard section for templates
6. `components/dashboard/template-preview-modal.tsx` - Modal for previewing templates

### Implementation Notes
- The implementation uses a direct Google Drive API integration rather than storing file metadata in the database
- For development environments without API access, mock data is provided
- The system supports various file types with appropriate icons and preview methods
- Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle API failures
