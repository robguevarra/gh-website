# User Purchase History and Enrollments - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement comprehensive purchase history and enrollment sections in the user detail view to provide administrators with a complete overview of user transactions and course enrollments.

## Current State Assessment
The user detail view currently has tabs for profile information, membership details, security settings, and administrative tools. However, it lacks dedicated sections for viewing a user's purchase history and course enrollments, which are critical for customer support and administrative tasks.

## Future State Goal
A robust user detail view with dedicated tabs for:
1. Purchase History - Showing all transactions with detailed information
2. Course Enrollments - Displaying all courses the user is enrolled in with progress and status

These sections will allow administrators to:
- View complete purchase history with transaction details
- Track course enrollments and progress
- Identify and resolve payment or enrollment issues
- Generate reports on user spending and engagement
