# Lead Email Marketing System - Phase 1 - Strategy and Implementation

## Task Objective
Develop a comprehensive email marketing strategy for leads captured through our landing pages (P2P, Canva, Shopify) that doesn't require forcing them into the unified_profiles/auth.users system, maintaining our current registration flow while enabling targeted marketing campaigns.

## Current State Assessment
- **Lead Capture System**: âœ… Working - captures leads in `purchase_leads` table via `/api/leads/capture`
- **Unified Profiles Constraint**: ðŸš« `unified_profiles.id = auth.users.id` (FK constraint) - requires authentication
- **Email Marketing Infrastructure**: âœ… Postmark integration ready with templates and campaigns
- **Tagging System**: âœ… Ready with proper tag relationships, but tied to `user_tags` (requires unified_profiles)
- **Current Flow**: Leads captured â†’ No email marketing (gap identified)

## Future State Goal
- **Standalone Lead Marketing**: Direct email marketing to leads without forcing authentication
- **Progressive Profiling**: Convert high-intent leads to registered users naturally
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Product-specific email sequences based on lead source
- **Compliance**: Proper opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Analytics**: Track engagement and conversion rates

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option A: Separate Lead Email Marketing System (RECOMMENDED)
**Approach**: Create dedicated email marketing for leads, separate from user marketing
**Pros**:
- âœ… No changes to existing auth flow
- âœ… Fast implementation
- âœ… Separate lead nurturing pipeline
- âœ… Can still convert leads to users later

**Implementation**:
- Create `lead_email_marketing` table
- Add `email_marketing_subscribed` to `purchase_leads`
- Dedicated Postmark templates for leads
- Separate campaign management

### Option B: Hybrid System with Lead Tags
**Approach**: Create `lead_tags` table parallel to `user_tags`
**Pros**:
- âœ… Consistent tagging architecture
- âœ… Easy migration when leads convert to users
- âœ… Unified reporting possible

**Implementation**:
- Create `lead_tags` table (lead_id, tag_id)
- Duplicate tag management for leads
- Unified campaign system

### Option C: Virtual Profiles for Leads (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Approach**: Create virtual auth.users for leads
**Cons**:
- ðŸš« Pollutes auth system
- ðŸš« Complex cleanup required
- ðŸš« Security implications
- ðŸš« Goes against best practices

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Database Schema Design
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create `lead_email_marketing` table
  ```sql

### Automatic Tagging Flow
```typescript
// On lead capture, automatically tag based on product type
const tagMapping = {
  'P2P': 'f125358c-1807-4cb1-b426-5c38cab59e62', // P2P Purchase Lead
