# Graceful Homeschooling - Project Context

## Executive Summary

Graceful Homeschooling aims to create an award-winning platform for homeschooling resources, education, and community. The website is built on a solid technical foundation using Next.js 15 with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and various modern web technologies. This document outlines the project scope, current state, and improvement roadmap.

## Technical Foundation

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with a custom design system
- **Components**: Comprehensive UI component library based on Radix UI primitives
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for sophisticated animations and transitions
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **API Integration**: API routes for social media integration and payment processing
- **Authentication**: Not fully implemented but groundwork exists
- **Data Fetching**: Client-side with fallbacks for API limitations

## Current Features

- **Homepage**: Introduces the platform and its value proposition
- **Papers to Profits**: E-commerce product page with payment processing
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateway
- **Social Proof**: Integration with YouTube and Facebook (currently limited by API quota)

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching functionality
- **Custom Animations**: Page transitions and UI element animations

## Content Structure

- Limited page structure (primarily homepage and product page)
- Focus on product offering (Papers to Profits)
- Social media integration for content reinforcement
- Limited educational resources directly on the platform

## Project Goals

1. Transform the current website into an award-winning platform
2. Expand functionality with educational resources, community features, and interactive tools
3. Improve user experience through advanced interactivity and personalization
4. Enhance visual design with custom illustrations, micro-interactions, and cohesive aesthetics
5. Optimize performance, accessibility, and SEO for maximum reach and usability

## Implementation Strategy

The project will be implemented in four strategic phases:

1. **Foundation Enhancements** (1-2 months): Focus on performance, accessibility, content strategy, SEO, and analytics
2. **Content & Experience Expansion** (2-3 months): Build educational resources library, blog, user accounts, and community features
3. **Differentiating Features** (3-4 months): Develop interactive tools, AI assistant, collaborative features, and personalization
4. **Polish & Optimization** (1-2 months): Conduct testing, performance optimization, and prepare for award submissions

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Next.js 15+**: Leverage App Router, React Server Components (RSC), and SSR capabilities
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling with consistent design system
- **Shadcn UI**: For component library (manage using `npx shadcn@latest add`)
- **Zustand**: For client-side state management when necessary
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions

## Development Standards

- Mobile-first approach and responsive design
- Functional, declarative programming (no OOP or classes)
- Maximum file size of 150 lines
- Semantic variable naming with auxiliary verbs
- Server-side logic emphasized (minimal `use client` usage)
- PWA structure with offline capabilities
