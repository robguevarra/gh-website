- **Theme**: Match main site design system with administrative functionality
- **Components**: Based on Shadcn UI with custom admin-specific components
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design with optimized mobile views for key functions

### Technical Architecture

- **Route Structure**:
  ```
  /admin
    /dashboard
    /users
      /[id]
    /courses
      /new
      /[id]/edit
    /media
    /emails
      /templates
      /campaigns
      /workflows
    /orders
    /community
    /analytics
    /settings
  ```

- **State Management**:
  - Zustand for client-side state
  - React Query for server data fetching and caching
  - Form state management with React Hook Form

- **API Integration**:
  - RESTful API endpoints for all admin operations
  - Real-time updates for dashboard via WebSockets where appropriate
  - Batched operations for performance-intensive tasks

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for all routes and operations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all administrative actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and abuse
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation for all data entry
