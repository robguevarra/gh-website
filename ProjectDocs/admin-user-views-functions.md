```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_transaction_insert()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'completed' AND NEW.transaction_type = 'P2P' THEN
    INSERT INTO enrollments (id, user_id, course_id, transaction_id, status, enrolled_at)
    SELECT
      gen_random_uuid(), NEW.user_id,
      (SELECT id FROM courses WHERE lower(title) = 'papers to profits' LIMIT 1),
      NEW.id, 'active', NEW.paid_at
    ON CONFLICT (user_id, course_id) DO NOTHING;
  END IF;

- Functions for profile synchronization and updates
- Triggers for maintaining data integrity
- Views for comprehensive user information

### 2. Transaction and Enrollment Tracking

The database objects support transaction and enrollment tracking through:
- The transactions and enrollments tables for storing core data
- Functions for generating and managing enrollments
- Triggers for automatic enrollment creation
- Views for unified purchase history

### 3. Reporting and Analytics

The database objects support reporting and analytics through:
- Views that combine data from multiple sources
- Functions for calculating metrics and trends
- Aggregation logic for summarizing user activity
- Filtering capabilities for segmentation

## Recommendations for Enhancement

1. **Add User Activity Aggregation View**
   - Create a view that aggregates user activity by type and time period
   - Include engagement metrics like session count and duration
   - Support trend analysis over time

2. **Implement User Segmentation Functions**
   - Create functions for segmenting users by behavior and attributes
   - Support cohort analysis based on acquisition date
   - Enable targeting for marketing and communication

3. **Enhance Audit Logging**
   - Add more granular logging for specific administrative actions
   - Implement retention policies for audit logs
   - Create views for simplified audit reporting

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Add materialized views for frequently accessed reports
   - Implement refresh strategies for materialized views
   - Add indexes for common query patterns

## Conclusion

The existing views, functions, and triggers provide a solid foundation for the admin user management system. They implement key business logic, maintain data integrity, and support reporting needs. The recommended enhancements will further improve the system's capabilities and performance.

The next steps should focus on:
1. Creating the entity relationship diagram (ERD) to visualize the data model
2. Implementing the user interface components that leverage these database objects
3. Developing additional functions and views as needed for specific admin features
