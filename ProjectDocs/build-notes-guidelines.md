4. [Templates](#templates)
5. [Example Build Note](#example-build-note)

## Purpose

Build notes and context references serve several crucial functions in the Graceful Homeschooling development process:

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture decisions, approaches, and reasoning for future reference
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: Help new developers understand the codebase more quickly
- **Development Continuity**: Ensure consistent development practices over time
- **Technical Documentation**: Document system architecture and implementation details

## Build Notes Structure

### File Location and Naming

Build notes should be stored in the appropriate directory based on their status:

```
ProjectDocs/
  ├── Build_Notes/
  │   ├── active/         # Current, in-progress build notes
  │   ├── completed/      # Finished build notes for reference
  │   └── archived/       # Deprecated or obsolete build notes
  ├── contexts/           # Project-wide context documents
  └── templates/          # Templates for documentation
```

**Naming Convention**:
- Use the format: `<build-title>_phase-<number>_<task-group-name>.md`
- Example: `supabase-schema-standardization_phase-1_preparation-and-code-analysis.md`

### Required Sections

Each build note must contain the following sections in order:

#### 1. Title
A clear, descriptive title that identifies the build task.

```markdown
# Platform Integration - Phase 2-1: Course Management
```

#### 2. Task Objective
A concise explanation of what the build aims to achieve.

```markdown
## Task Objective
Implement comprehensive course management capabilities for the Graceful Homeschooling platform, enabling administrators to create, edit, publish, and manage courses and their content.
```

#### 3. Current State Assessment
A brief description of the current state of the project pertaining to the build tasks.

```markdown
## Current State Assessment
The platform currently has basic database schema for courses but lacks user interfaces and functionality for course creation, content management, and publishing workflows. Administrators need a way to manage course content through the admin interface.
```

#### 4. Future State Goal
A clear description of the desired end state after the build is completed.

```markdown
## Future State Goal
A fully functional course management system with intuitive interfaces for administrators to create courses, organize content into modules and lessons, upload media, and control publishing status. Course content should be structured consistently and accessed efficiently by the user-facing course delivery system.
```

#### 5. Relevant Context
References to related documentation and prior work.

```markdown
## Relevant Context

> **Important**: When working on this build note, always ensure proper context integration from:
> 1. Previously completed build notes (Phase 1-0 through Phase 1-6)
> 2. Project context (`ProjectContext.md`)
> 3. Design context (`designContext.md`)
>
> This ensures consistency and alignment with project goals and standards.

### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our course management approach:
- **Course Structure**: Hierarchical organization with courses, modules, and lessons
- **Content Types**: Support for text, images, video, and interactive elements
- **User Roles**: Different access levels for course creation and management

### From Previously Completed Phases
The project has already completed:
- **Phase 1-3**: Database Schema Implementation (including course-related tables)
- **Phase 1-6**: Project Structure (establishing coding patterns and documentation standards)

These implementations have established patterns that should be leveraged in this phase.
```

```markdown
---

> **Note to AI Developers**: When working with this project, always ensure that you:
> 1. Review previously completed build notes for context and established patterns
> 2. Consult the implementation strategy and architecture planning documents
> 3. Align your work with the project context and design context guidelines
> 4. Follow the established folder structure, naming conventions, and coding standards
> 5. Include this reminder in all future build notes to maintain consistency
```

### Required Formatting Standards

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Use ATX-style headers (`#` for headings, not underlines)
- Use bullet points (`-`) for lists
- Use checklist format (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`) for tasks
- Use code fences (``` for code blocks with language specified (e.g., ```tsx)
- Include a horizontal rule (---) before the final note to AI developers

## Context Reference Guidelines

### Master Context Documents

The following master context documents should be referenced in all build notes:

1. **Project Context** (`ProjectContext.md`): Core project goals, requirements, and technical decisions
2. **Design Context** (`designContext.md`): Design system, UI patterns, and user experience guidelines

### Extracting Relevant Context

When referencing context from other documents:

1. **Be Specific**: Extract only the portions relevant to the current build
2. **Maintain Hierarchy**: Preserve the heading structure from the source
3. **Add Value**: Explain why the context is relevant to the current build
4. **Cite Sources**: Always specify the source document for the context

```markdown
### From Project Context
From the `ProjectContext.md`, the following key points inform our approach:
- **Authentication**: PKCE flow for secure authentication with Supabase
- **User Roles**: Tiered access controls for different user types

### From Design Context
From the `designContext.md`, these design principles apply:
- **Form Design**: Consistent validation patterns and error states
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for all async operations
```

### Cross-Referencing Approach

When referencing other build notes or documentation:

1. **Use Relative Links**: Link directly to relevant documents when possible
2. **Specify Versions/Dates**: Include the version or date of referenced material
3. **Quote Directly**: When applicable, use block quotes to include critical information

```markdown
As documented in [Phase 1-3: Database Schema Implementation](../completed/platform-integration_phase1-3_database-schema-implementation.md) (completed February 15, 2024), the course table structure includes:

> Course content is organized hierarchically with three levels:
> 1. **Courses**: The top-level container with metadata
> 2. **Modules**: Logical groupings of related content
> 3. **Lessons**: Individual content units with various types
```
