# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Data Retention and Privacy Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create mechanisms for handling affiliate data according to the retention policy, including soft-deletion of PII.
# Details:
1. Implement a CRON job to identify inactive affiliates
2. Create soft-delete functionality for PII after 6 months of inactivity
3. Maintain aggregate data while anonymizing personal information
4. Implement database triggers or functions to handle the soft-delete process
5. Create audit logs for all data retention actions
6. Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations
7. Add admin controls to manually trigger data anonymization when needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Test automatic identification of inactive affiliates
2. Verify soft-delete functionality works correctly
3. Validate that aggregate data remains intact while PII is removed
4. Test manual anonymization controls
5. Verify audit logging for all data retention actions
6. Test with various edge cases and data scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Inactive Affiliate Identification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to identify affiliates who have been inactive for the specified retention period
### Details:
Develop a query mechanism to identify affiliates who haven't logged in or performed any transactions within the defined retention period (e.g., 24 months). Create a scheduled job that flags these accounts for data retention processing. Include configurable parameters for retention periods based on jurisdiction and account type. Implement notification system to alert affiliates before their data is processed for anonymization.

## 2. Develop PII Soft-Deletion Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create functionality to soft-delete personally identifiable information while maintaining necessary records
### Details:
Design database schema modifications to support soft-deletion of PII. Implement functions to replace PII fields with anonymized values while preserving non-sensitive data. Create a data dictionary defining which fields contain PII and their anonymization methods. Develop rollback capability for accidental deletion. Ensure functionality works across all relevant database tables containing affiliate information.

## 3. Implement Database Triggers for Anonymization [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create database triggers that automatically anonymize sensitive data when specific conditions are met
### Details:
Design and implement database triggers that activate when an affiliate is marked for data retention processing. Create cascading anonymization processes that handle related tables and foreign key relationships. Implement transaction safety mechanisms to ensure data integrity during anonymization. Test triggers thoroughly with various data scenarios to verify proper anonymization without data corruption.

## 4. Develop Audit Logging and Admin Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Create comprehensive audit logging and administrative controls for the data retention process
### Details:
Implement detailed audit logging for all data retention activities, including who initiated actions, what data was anonymized, and when actions occurred. Create an admin dashboard for authorized personnel to review and manage data retention processes. Develop override capabilities for legal holds or compliance requirements. Implement reporting functionality for regulatory compliance. Create documentation for administrators on using these controls properly.
