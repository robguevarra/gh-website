# Task ID: 38
# Title: Integrate Email Analytics Dashboard section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add email analytics capabilities to the admin dashboard in two key areas: (1) platform-wide email analytics section and (2) per-user email event statistics in user detail views. This task consolidates all email analytics integration work to avoid redundancy.
# Details:
This task involves two main components:

1. **Platform-wide Email Analytics Dashboard** (COMPLETED):
   - Created a new section in the admin dashboard dedicated to email analytics
   - Implemented metric cards showing key email performance indicators
   - Added trend charts to visualize email metrics over time using Recharts
   - Integrated a table showing top email bounces and delivery issues
   - Built with modular, mobile-first approach using Shadcn UI components
   - Data fetched from `/api/email/analytics` endpoint

2. **Per-User Email Event Statistics** (IN PROGRESS):
   - Integrate email event data into the user detail view
   - Connect to appropriate API endpoints to fetch user-specific email data
   - Display email open rates, click-through rates, and delivery status for individual users
   - Implement filtering and sorting capabilities for user email events

Refer to Email System Phase 2 build notes for design specifications, API documentation, and technical summary of the completed platform-wide analytics implementation.

# Test Strategy:
**Testing Strategy**:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test API integration for both dashboard-wide and per-user analytics
   - Verify correct data parsing and transformation
   - Test component rendering with mock data

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify dashboard analytics section loads and displays data correctly
   - Confirm user detail view properly shows email statistics
   - Test navigation between views

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Complete workflow testing from admin login to viewing both analytics sections
   - Verify filters and interactive elements work as expected
   - Test responsiveness across different screen sizes
