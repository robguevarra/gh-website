# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Data Access Layer for Admin Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create server-side functions and optimized SQL queries for common administrative data operations.
# Details:
Implement a set of TypeScript functions that handle data access for admin operations including: 1) paginated user queries with filtering, 2) detailed user profile retrieval with related data, 3) audit logging functions, 4) user update operations. Use Supabase client with proper error handling and optimize queries for performance. Implement caching strategies where appropriate for frequently accessed data.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each data access function, testing both success paths and error handling. Benchmark query performance against requirements (2-3 second load times).
