# Task ID: 35
# Title: Phase 2: Build Out Advanced Email Features & User Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: With the core infrastructure in place, this phase focuses on developing advanced email capabilities with webhook processing integration as a primary focus area, enabling user segmentation, campaign management, detailed analytics, and user preference systems.
# Details:
This phase will prioritize webhook processing as a key component for email analytics and user preference management. Tasks include: Webhook endpoint architecture and event processing (Tasks 1, 2, 10), User tagging and segmentation (Task 20), Campaign Management System (Task 22), comprehensive Email Analytics Dashboard (Task 25), and User Email Preference Management (Task 26). Webhook integration is critical as it provides the real-time data foundation for analytics and user preference updates.
