# Task ID: 21
# Title: Email Template Management Interface
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: low
# Description: This task is deprecated. The Email Template Management Interface functionality has been fully addressed by the integration of the Unlayer email editor (see Task 32).
# Details:
This task has been superseded by the implementation of the Unlayer email editor, which provides comprehensive template management capabilities including:

1. Visual WYSIWYG editor for template editing
2. Template management UI with listing, search, and filtering
3. Template creation workflow
4. Template preview functionality
5. Variable management for personalization
6. Template versioning and organization features

Please refer to Task 32 and the associated documentation at `ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/unlayer-email-editor-integration_phase-1_implementation.md` for details on the implemented solution.

The original implementation plan included:
1. ~~Design template management UI with listing, search, and filtering~~
2. ~~Implement template creation workflow~~
3. ~~Create visual WYSIWYG editor for template editing~~
4. ~~Add MJML code editor for advanced users~~
5. ~~Implement template versioning and history~~
6. ~~Add template preview functionality~~
7. ~~Create template categories for organization~~
8. ~~Implement template duplication and templating~~
9. ~~Add variable management for personalization~~

All these requirements have been addressed by the Unlayer integration.

# Test Strategy:
No testing required for this task as it has been deprecated. Testing for email template management functionality should be performed as part of Task 32 (Unlayer email editor integration).
