# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Fraud Detection Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a fraud detection system that automatically flags suspicious affiliate activity based on defined thresholds.
# Details:
1. Implement a CRON job that runs every 30 minutes
2. Check for fraud patterns:
   - CVR > 50% on ≥50 clicks in any 24-hour window
   - ≥3 self-purchases in any 24-hour window
3. Insert detected issues into the fraud_flags table
4. Update affiliate status to 'flagged' when fraud is detected
5. Implement the notification system for fraud flags
6. Create detailed logging for audit purposes
7. Ensure the system can handle the expected data volume

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with simulated fraud patterns to verify detection
2. Validate flagging thresholds are correctly applied
3. Test notification system for fraud flags
4. Performance testing with large datasets
5. Verify audit logging is comprehensive
6. Test edge cases and boundary conditions

# Subtasks:
## 1. CRON Job Setup for Fraud Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a scheduled CRON job to periodically run the fraud detection engine
### Details:
Create a configurable CRON job that runs at appropriate intervals (hourly/daily). Ensure proper error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms. Include monitoring to verify job execution and completion. Design the job to handle large datasets efficiently with pagination or batching.

## 2. Fraud Pattern Detection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to identify suspicious patterns in affiliate activities
### Details:
Implement algorithms for detecting common fraud patterns: click fraud, conversion manipulation, IP spoofing, and unusual traffic spikes. Create statistical models for anomaly detection based on historical data. Include configurable thresholds for different fraud types. Design the system to adapt to new patterns over time.

## 3. Flagging System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a system to flag suspicious activities and affiliates based on detection results
### Details:
Develop a multi-level flagging system (warning, suspicious, confirmed fraud). Implement a review queue for manual verification of flagged activities. Create an API for updating affiliate status based on fraud findings. Include mechanisms to prevent false positives through confidence scoring.

## 4. Notification System and Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement notification mechanisms and comprehensive audit logging
### Details:
Integrate with email/SMS notification systems to alert about fraud detection. Create a detailed audit log of all fraud detection activities and status changes. Implement performance monitoring and optimization for the entire fraud detection pipeline. Design a dashboard for visualizing fraud patterns and detection effectiveness.
