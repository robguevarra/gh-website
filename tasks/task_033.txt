# Task ID: 33
# Title: Deprecate TipTap-based Admin Interface for Email Templates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31, 32
# Priority: low
# Description: The admin interface for email template management, originally planned as part of Task 31 (Implement Direct HTML Email Template System) using TipTap, is now deprecated. This functionality is superseded by the Unlayer email editor integration (Task 32), which provides a comprehensive template management interface.
# Details:
This task records the deprecation of the planned TipTap-based admin interface for managing email templates (originally subtask 31.9 under Task #31). The Unlayer email editor (Task #32) now provides the required visual editor and template management capabilities. No further work is needed on the TipTap-based admin interface for email templates.

# Test Strategy:
N/A - Informational task. Verify Task 32 (Unlayer) covers all admin template management needs.
