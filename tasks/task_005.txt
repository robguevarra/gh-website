# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement User List View with Pagination
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the responsive data table at /admin/users with basic pagination functionality.
# Details:
Most of the implementation for the /admin/users page has been completed, including:

1. A server component that fetches paginated user data using our data access layer
2. A responsive data table using Shadcn UI components showing key user information
3. Advanced filtering capabilities (status, acquisition source, transaction history, date ranges)
4. Pagination controls with URL parameter state persistence
5. Loading states and error handling
6. Quick action buttons for viewing and editing user details

Remaining work focuses on performance optimization and responsive testing to ensure the implementation meets requirements across all device sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the implementation meets the 2-second initial load requirement across various network conditions. Test pagination with different page sizes to ensure consistent performance. Validate responsive behavior across device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to confirm usability on all screen dimensions. Verify that all implemented features (filtering, sorting, pagination, quick actions) work correctly across devices.

# Subtasks:
## 5.1. Performance optimization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize the current implementation to ensure it meets the 2-second initial load requirement. This may include implementing data caching strategies, optimizing database queries, or adding virtualization for large data sets.
### Details:


## 5.2. Cross-device responsive testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the user list view across multiple device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure the responsive design works correctly. Verify that all functionality remains accessible and usable regardless of screen size.
### Details:


## 5.3. Performance testing documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document performance test results showing that the implementation meets the 2-second initial load requirement under various conditions (different page sizes, filter combinations, etc.).
