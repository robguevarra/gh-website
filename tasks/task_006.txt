# Task ID: 6
# Title: Add Search, Filtering and Sorting to User List
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the user list with robust search capabilities, advanced filtering, and column sorting.
# Details:
The user list has been enhanced with column sorting functionality and improved filtering UI. Completed work includes: (1) Column sorting with visual indicators for sort direction and URL parameter reflection, (2) Enhanced filtering UI with toggle functionality and fixed parameter/TypeScript issues, (3) Improved UX with cleaner UI and responsive design. Next steps include implementing advanced search functionality with typeahead suggestions and field-specific search capabilities. All implementations follow Next.js best practices with proper separation of client and server components.

# Test Strategy:
Test search with partial matches and special characters. Verify all filters work correctly in combination. Test sorting on different columns and ensure visual indicators match the current sort state. Ensure URL parameters correctly reflect all filter and sort states. Test responsive design across various screen sizes.
