5. Handle multi-level attribution (up to 2 levels)
6. Set initial conversion status to 'pending'
7. Implement webhook signature verification for security
8. Add error handling and logging for debugging

# Test Strategy:
1. Test webhook with various Xendit payload scenarios
2. Verify commission calculations for different affiliate levels and member statuses
3. Test multi-level attribution
4. Validate conversion data is correctly stored in the database
5. Test security measures including signature verification
6. Simulate edge cases like missing cookies or invalid affiliate IDs

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Xendit Webhook Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
