# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Administrative Tools and Access Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build administrative tooling including password reset, account status management, and access controls.
# Details:
Create an administrative tools tab with functionality for password reset, account status changes (active/inactive/suspended), and feature access management. Implement secure server actions for these operations with appropriate confirmation workflows. Add detailed logging to admin_audit_log for all administrative actions. Include email notification options for relevant actions (e.g., password reset).

# Test Strategy:
Test each administrative action for proper execution and audit logging. Verify confirmation workflows prevent accidental changes. Test email notifications if implemented.
