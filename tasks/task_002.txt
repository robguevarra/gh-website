# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Affiliate Authentication with Existing Supabase Auth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing authentication system to support affiliate signup, login, and role-based access control using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
1. Implement the /affiliate/signup endpoint that integrates with Supabase Auth
2. Create flow: email → OTP verification → pending status
3. Update user_metadata to include affiliate status
4. Extend the existing checkAdminAccess pattern to include affiliate role checks
5. Implement logic to detect user types (student, affiliate, admin, or combinations)
6. Store affiliate status in the user's profile
7. Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures
8. Set up security headers and CSRF protection

# Test Strategy:
1. Test signup flow with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify OTP verification process
3. Test authentication with different user roles
4. Validate that user_metadata correctly stores affiliate status
5. Test error scenarios and edge cases
6. Security testing for authentication endpoints

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Affiliate Signup Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated API endpoint for affiliate user registration with appropriate validation and error handling
### Details:
Develop a RESTful endpoint that accepts affiliate registration data, validates input fields, handles duplicate checks, and returns appropriate status codes. Include documentation for the endpoint structure and required parameters.

## 2. Develop OTP Verification Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build a complete one-time password verification system for user authentication
### Details:
Implement OTP generation, delivery (email/SMS), verification logic, expiration handling, and retry limitations. Include fallback mechanisms and security measures to prevent brute force attacks.

## 3. Extend User Metadata Schema [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Enhance the user data model to support additional metadata fields required for different user types
### Details:
Modify database schema to include fields for user preferences, profile completeness, verification status, and user-specific settings. Ensure backward compatibility and create migration scripts for existing users.

## 4. Implement Role-Based Access Control [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive RBAC system to manage permissions across different user types
### Details:
Define role hierarchies, permission sets, and access control lists. Implement middleware for route protection, role verification, and permission checking. Include admin interfaces for role management.

## 5. Develop User Type Detection Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create mechanisms to identify and differentiate between various user types in the system
### Details:
Implement algorithms to detect user types based on behavior patterns, registration source, and profile data. Create type-specific workflows and user experiences based on detected types.

## 6. Implement Security Hardening Measures [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Enhance authentication security through additional protective measures
### Details:
Add rate limiting, implement JWT with appropriate expiration, add CSRF protection, enable secure cookie handling, implement IP-based suspicious activity detection, and conduct security testing against common vulnerabilities.
