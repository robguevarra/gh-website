# Task ID: 2
# Title: Enhance Data Model with Admin-Required Fields
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement additional tables and fields required for administrative functionality based on the audit findings.
# Details:
Create migration scripts for Supabase to add: 1) admin_audit_log table for tracking administrative actions, 2) user_notes table for administrative annotations, 3) additional fields to unified_profiles for admin-specific flags and metadata. Implement proper foreign key relationships and indexes for performance. Create TypeScript interfaces for all enhanced data models to ensure type safety throughout the application.

# Test Strategy:
Execute migrations in development environment, verify table structure matches design, and test basic CRUD operations on new tables. Create sample data to validate relationships.
