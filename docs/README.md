# Graceful Homeschooling Design Documentation

Welcome to the design documentation for the Graceful Homeschooling website. This collection of documents provides comprehensive guidelines and standards for maintaining design consistency across the website.

## Document Overview

### [Design System Documentation](./design-system.md)

The comprehensive source of truth for all design-related decisions and implementations. This document covers:

- Brand identity and values
- Color system (light and dark modes)
- Typography guidelines
- Spacing system
- Border radius and shadows
- Component styles
- Animation guidelines
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility standards

Use this document when you need detailed information about any aspect of the design system or when making significant design decisions.

### [Visual Design Guide](./visual-design-guide.md)

A more visual and concise reference guide focused on practical examples. This document includes:

- Visual representations of color palettes
- Typography examples
- Component code snippets
- Animation examples
- Implementation checklists

Use this document as a quick reference when implementing designs or when you need to see visual examples of the design system in action.

### [Component Usage Guide](./component-usage-guide.md)

A practical guide for when and how to use specific UI components. This document covers:

- Use cases for each component
- Best practices
- Code examples
- Accessibility considerations
- Implementation guidelines

Use this document when deciding which components to use for specific use cases or when you need guidance on component implementation.

## How to Use These Documents

1. **For New Developers/Designers**: Start with the Design System Documentation to understand the overall design principles, then refer to the Visual Design Guide and Component Usage Guide for specific implementation details.

2. **For Quick Reference**: Use the Visual Design Guide when you need a quick reference for colors, typography, or component examples.

3. **For Component Selection**: Consult the Component Usage Guide when deciding which component to use for a specific UI element.

4. **For Design Decisions**: Refer to the Design System Documentation when making design decisions to ensure consistency with the established design principles.

## Maintaining These Documents

These documents should be treated as living documents that evolve as the design system evolves. When making significant changes to the design system:

1. Update the relevant sections in all documents
2. Include examples of the changes in the Visual Design Guide
3. Update use cases and best practices in the Component Usage Guide
4. Document the rationale for changes in the Design System Documentation

## Questions and Contributions

If you have questions about the design system or want to contribute to these documents, please contact the design team or follow the project's contribution guidelines.
